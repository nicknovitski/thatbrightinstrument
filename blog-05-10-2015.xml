      Show image as background to text. You can't really calculate the width
      reliably in JS because margins are not taken into account by any of
      clientWidth, offsetWidth or scrollWidth, so we don't force a minimum
      width if the user is using shrink to fit.
      This results in a margin-width's worth of pixels being cropped. If the
      user is not using shrink to fit then we expand the header.

href="http://nicknovitski.com/"&gt;Nick Novitski&lt;/a&gt; as a domain. &amp;nbsp;It's nice to have an odd enough name that your first choice of brand is available to you. &amp;nbsp;Although, if I were really smart, I would have gotten mylastname.com before that jerk in Texas did (just kidding man, congrats on the wedding).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right now, it just mirrors my new Tumblr blog. &amp;nbsp;Tumblr seems like a pretty good platform. &amp;nbsp;I'm not using the social elements to their highest degree, but there's a lot of good integration with other services and devices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing missing is a tool to easily transfer my posts from here to there&amp;nbsp;(though looking back makes me wonder if I really want to). &amp;nbsp;Since I can download them as an XML file, though, I wonder if I could &lt;a href="http://nokogiri.org/"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://github.com/mwunsch/tumblr"&gt;one&lt;/a&gt;...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This blog will lay defunct, but as-is, until I formulate a complete transfer solution, at which point I'll set up an automatic redirect. &amp;nbsp;But in the meantime, &lt;a

type='text'>San Francisco~ Vol II</title><content type='html'>THE HOUSE: A pre-Civil War carriage house smack in Hayes Valley. Two bedrooms upstairs, living/dining room, bathroom and kitchen in the final throes of a remodel. Down stairs is a yard, a garden level bedroom, and the garage, which has basically been converted into our studios (you'll get a station in the studio).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're a "Watch TV where you masturbate household," which roughly translates to not in shared spaces unless you're feeling exhibitionistic. We have frequent, though not constant, guests who join us for breakfast, or tea, or a glass of wine. No couch surfers unless they're in bed with you. We LOVE musicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'd like to share food, but we're on conflicting schedules so that's not happening too much right now. We LIVE for Brunch, especially on Sunday. Our kitchen is blessed with a 1920's ish farmhouse Wedgewood named Viviane. Her oven doesn't work at the moment so we're stovetop boys. Open (though admittedly resistant) to the possibility of a toaster oven in the mean time if it's a must for ya.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"The Most Wonderful Time of the Year" is just around the corner. Actually, it's here. The Wysteria has started blooming as of this week! The smell will intoxicate you when it gets up to full speed and you will lay in bed entranced by the bountiful purple cakes of blossoms dangling outside your bedroom window. Spring is a miraculous time here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Includes utilities (gas, electric, and water), internet, and laundry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ample bike parking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YOU: Comfortable with animals: Dood, an 88 pound chuck of sheer muscle and love, and Iola, a middle aged cat with an agenda of her own. Tidy without being OCD. Engaged but not fixated. Active. Spacey but grounded. Probably an early-thirty-something faggot, but we're open to explore. Employed or independently wealthy. Kind. Comfortable with process, but able to solidify into product when necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;US: Two aforementioned early-thirty-something-faggots. Ralph works in costume design and food service and dreams of lemonade. Will is a full time student with no idea what he does although it generally resembles a chicken running around with its head cut off. We try and do our dishes before we eat, support each other in healthy choices, and laugh together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And we look forward to meeting you.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/4505056946334782435'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/4505056946334782435'/><author><name>Nick Novitski</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08863651199447917923</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31707300.post-6596479314297823422</id><published>2011-03-14T17:48:00.001-04:00</published><updated>2011-03-15T20:30:57.635-04:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>Perhaps appropriately, the Computer History Museum's flagship exhibit, &lt;i&gt;Revolution: The First 2000 Years of Computing&lt;/i&gt;, is by far the most informationally dense exhibit I have ever been exposed to, bar none. &amp;nbsp;On my first day, I was able to reach electricity. &amp;nbsp;On my second day, I was able to complete Integrated Circuits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Computing, like any modern utility, now has is dense&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another absolute treasure is the wealth of commercial literature reproduced. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Securing the rights must have been a nightmare. &amp;nbsp;There's a video that plays classic videogame advertisements, including the classic Atari Centipede! one, and also including...exactly one other that I don't remember. &amp;nbsp;So not very many, is what I'm saying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're anything like me (god help you), you'll flip your shit for the Charlie Chaplin ads&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was a guy who had been around the block. And he wasn’t very old, so he decided to write a biography of his life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, he started to lie in his biography. He made up some stories. But mostly little stories that were inconsequential. Filler. Like he had a story about a painting he’d done of a red background with elephant legs in front. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But he hadn’t ever painted anything of the sort. He further embellished the story by talking about a pricey auction he’d snuck into. An auction in New York City where he’d he overheard his painting go to sale for twenty grand. But that wasn’t the point of the story. The point was that he could fold his body to fit under a lid on a banquet tray. People would raise the lid and they wouldn’t even notice him bracing himself inside. He didn’t even mention the price his painting sold at. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, he really started to like that story (and others like it), to the point where he started to ignore his friends and family, instead preferring to watch what his lie self did after the auction. In his head. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, then, one day he was shopping and he found a pair of shoes that had stripey laces. And he grabbed the shoes and went to the store counter, forcing them in the cashier’s face, yelling, “Look! Look at these! Look! These are the shoes my lie self would wear!”</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/6596479314297823422'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/6596479314297823422'/><author><name>Nick Novitski</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08863651199447917923</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31707300.post-7402385869743185514</id><published>2011-03-09T22:21:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2011-03-09T22:21:00.654-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='travel'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='neologism'/><title type='text'>Money is Broken</title><content type='html'>Jane McGonigal is about to &lt;s&gt;give a talk&lt;/s&gt;&amp;nbsp;have a conversation about her new book (&lt;i&gt;Reality is Broken&lt;/i&gt;, available in fine bookstores everywhere, as well as my hot little hands).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The CHM is ridiculous. &amp;nbsp;Mountain View contains concentrations of wealth that I have not encountered anywhere in my life, and that includes, say, the Hearst Mansion, or the mansions of those latter-day Hearsts who populate Highway 1 between Cambria and Monterey. &amp;nbsp;Imagine what sort of museum such people would make about the field that curls so closely about their hearts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw perhaps a quarter of it in two hours. &amp;nbsp;Slide-rules, abaci, punch-cards, a bit of COLOSSUS. &amp;nbsp;I will have to come back. &amp;nbsp;Possibly I will have to become a member.</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2011/03/money-is-broken.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/7402385869743185514'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/7402385869743185514'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2011/03/money-is-broken.html' title='Money is Broken'/><author><name>Nick Novitski</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08863651199447917923</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total><georss:featurename>Computer History Museum, 1401 N Shoreline Blvd, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA</georss:featurename><georss:point>37.4143152 -122.0772932</georss:point><georss:box>37.397272199999996 -122.1064757 37.4313582 -122.0481107</georss:box></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31707300.post-1979842103347904680</id><published>2011-03-03T15:52:00.001-05:00</published><updated>2011-03-03T15:52:51.476-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Home</title><content type='html'>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's the view from the living room of the jeweled treasure I'll be living in for the next month or three, anyway.&amp;#160;

Every room is perfectly hexagonal, with un-painted concrete walls.  The rooms surround hexagonal spaces strung along the hallway like so many ben-wa beads.  On the outside, delivery chutes stick out at least seven feet, so ostentatiously formerly-functional it becomes the height of a kind of luxury.  I feel like I'm becoming two people, the bee that goes out to forage, and the larva that wraps himself in the honey and does nothing but think "Change! Change!" &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Irvine, in general, puts me in mind of the malls, warehouses and empty spaces of the area around the Miami airport, but mapped to an expanded coordinate system, distances stretching out, like the expanding universe.  Every second spent here seems to make everything else one second further away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, tomorrow I drive to Morro Bay.  The day after that, the City By The Bay.  From moving out of Falls Church to arriving in San Francisco, that will be just about 53 days.  Maybe not an olympic record, but certainly a personal best, of a sort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and Arizona.  Arizona was a mixed bag.

Lost</title><content type='html'>So several decades ago, a TWA airplane crashed into a bit of the Sandia mountains that folks reasonably came to call "TWA Canyon." &amp;nbsp;It's only a few miles out of Albuquerque, but the area was roadless, rocky wilderness, impassable to earthmoving equipment, so rather than collecting all the wreckage and taking it away to some warehouse somewhere, they just kinda shuffled it around so that it couldn't be seen by from the cablecar tram that passed right overhead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can hike right there! &amp;nbsp;Or so I've heard. &amp;nbsp;Today I tried, but didn't quite manage it. &amp;nbsp;I wandered around for a bit, and greatly enjoyed it, but the trail in question is not marked, because, reasonably enough, the land managers don't want their trust known for such ghoulish amusements. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mean, it's not like I wanted to go because 16 people lost their lives on the spot. &amp;nbsp;It's just that, for reasons I haven't figured out, I really really like sites and scenes of industrial decay, and I think the wreckage of a plane is something I really want to see, even if it was just in some warehouse somewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as I said, it's strewn across untrammeled wilderness along the side of a big mountain. &amp;nbsp;Which is it's own bonus, as well as adding a bit of frisson to the image. &amp;nbsp;So I really wanted to see it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a gorgeous day, perfect t-shirt weather, and I love scrambling over rocks and trees and mud like you wouldn't believe. &amp;nbsp;But I gradually became less and less certain that I was in the right canyon. &amp;nbsp;Frequently, I questioned whether the trail I was following was used by anything besides deer and snowmelt. &amp;nbsp;So after a few hours, I decided to turn around. &amp;nbsp;No biggie, it was just an awesome hike. &amp;nbsp;I'll see the rotting wreckage of our once-glorious civilization another day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table style="width: 194px;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align="center" style="background: url(https://picasaweb.google.com/s/c/transparent_album_background.gif)

because the calories you eat are so damn filling. &amp;nbsp;I see that there's a microwave in the hotel room, and immediately think I could make bacon if I had a plate and some paper towels (and some bacon). &amp;nbsp;Meals on the road tend to be raw. &amp;nbsp;Hotels don't give you the tools to cook, they force travelers into nearby restaurants. &amp;nbsp;Pitcher-plant-style symbiosis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of carnivorous lures, I passed by a housing development populated by duplexes that seemed to be 80% garage. &amp;nbsp;Of course: survival out here requires a car, even before food. &amp;nbsp;Maybe even a truck? &amp;nbsp;The day felt warm, but slush and ice were spattered everywhere. &amp;nbsp;Stopping for lunch in Little Rock, I hesitated before stepping into the diner, until I was sure I wasn't going to be impaled by a falling icicle. &amp;nbsp;The same latitude as Atlanta, but something puts an edge on the weather, something that demands four-wheel-drive and space to haul hay-bales.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the radio today, between Egypt updates, proposed budget cuts were discussed. &amp;nbsp;A program that gives heating fuel to people who need it. &amp;nbsp;That is, they can only afford a big house in the frozen wastelands where humans should not live unless they are paid (cf Antarctica, Alaska). &amp;nbsp;Or else it's a family tradition to die in Maine. &amp;nbsp;Or else they're welfare queens or whatever ridiculous straw-man we've come up with now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can't tell if I'm still losing weight, or if my perceptions are being shifted ("expanded," you could say) by the people I see in the restaurants, the lobbies, the gas stations, the rest areas, and especially behind the wheel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, right. &amp;nbsp;All the rest areas in Arkansas were originally built&amp;nbsp;segregated. &amp;nbsp;Two sets of Male and Female bathrooms. &amp;nbsp;Now they just keep one closed until it's time to clean the other one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking over my route again, I just calculated that Las Vegas is actually about half an hour out of my way. &amp;nbsp;Hmm! &amp;nbsp;Though of course if I went there, I might stay for more than one day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still haven't made the phone calls I should. &amp;nbsp;There's always tomorrow, until there isn't.</content><link rel='replies'

Journey Begins</title><content type='html'>Arrived in Memphis yesterday. &amp;nbsp;Hope to reach Sallisaw, OK today. &amp;nbsp;Then Amarillo tomorrow, and Albuquerque on Sunday. &amp;nbsp;Fair progress after spending, what, two weeks in Virginia and three in Atlanta?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both were relaxing stays with friends. &amp;nbsp;Too relaxing. &amp;nbsp;I've gotten soft, become reliant on rolling out of bed and having real humans to talk to. &amp;nbsp;Or at least dogs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, right. &amp;nbsp;In Atlanta, I stayed in a studio with a 7-month-old labrador puppy named Gracie. &amp;nbsp;Things she destroyed of mine:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Electric Dragon 80,000V&lt;/i&gt;, a mildly rare artsy Japanese film. &amp;nbsp;DVD, case, soundtrack CD: all shredded.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;How To Cook Everything&lt;/i&gt;, an awesome cookbook. &amp;nbsp;Slipcase destroyed, index chewed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;40 Blinks Bucky Eyemask, devoured.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vibram Fivefingers KSOs, munched.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She was a good dog, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Driving through Mississipi and Alabama in one day helped me realize how our current circumstances determine our Apocalypses. &amp;nbsp;I kept seeing signs for the exits..."Food" it would say, with a perfectly blank hi-contrast expanse below. &amp;nbsp;"Gas", and then "nothing besides remains / the lone and level roads stretch far away." &amp;nbsp;Hence &lt;i&gt;The Road&lt;/i&gt;, an exurban Apocalyps, where people become so distanced from each other and so cut off from resources, they have no way of productively dealing with one another. &amp;nbsp;Compare with the rural Japanese Apocalypse of &lt;i&gt;Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou&lt;/i&gt;, where life has just slowed down, with fewer kids in the village every year, and the beach slowly reclaiming the parking lots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So-called "Dystopias" are Apoclypses as well, of course. &amp;nbsp;The world changes dramatically, the true nature of humanity (or of whatever you're afraid will constrain or warp it) reveals itself, is seen not through a glass darkly. &amp;nbsp;I keep on thinking that they'll make a &lt;i&gt;Snow Crash&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;movie, that it's yet to be made irrelevant, that it can be condensed into a dayglo meditation on gated communities and franchise restaurants. &amp;nbsp;And katanas, second life, wearable computing, and statutory rape, of course. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;McDonalds even have free wi-fi now, nearly as convenient and necessary as a bathroom. &amp;nbsp;The future is like a low fire that a map of your life has been thrown onto: the edges burn first, but occasionally more mundane spots, closer to home, blacken and swell. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;O let me stand next to that fire!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday, I stopped at a McDonalds to piss, and when I came out of the bathroom and headed to the door, someone on the staff sarcastically thanked me. &amp;nbsp;A few seconds later, I reeled from social vertigo: I hadn't even thought them worth enough consideration to turn and fully face them before scoffing. &amp;nbsp;I'm beginning to see why gypsies think it's okay to rob from non-gypsies. &amp;nbsp;People tie themselves to one place, one job, one lover, expecting to be rewarded for...what? &amp;nbsp;Self-doubt? &amp;nbsp;Fear? &amp;nbsp;Unquestioning service? &amp;nbsp;They're like the blacksmith from the Borges story who wrapped his son in chains so that when he died from the weight, he could fly in heaven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Graduation, lay-offs, the death of a close family member...I'm overdue for throwing my life away on a crazy plan. &amp;nbsp;Every day is a new opportunity to say "The Journey Begins Now." &amp;nbsp;Initiation never ends.</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html'

entirely undeserved ring. &amp;nbsp;Now we can finally throw him under the bus, right? &amp;nbsp;And once that's over with, we can talk about your sickening dependence on moribund for-profit companies that are destroying America, and how they think this is the economic moment to spend your benefits checks on Eminem and the most expensive advertising spot in the world to promote Detroit &lt;i&gt;as a luxury brand&lt;/i&gt;. &amp;nbsp;Luxury?! &amp;nbsp;If you offer a car "imported from Detroit," it better be from our feral-city future. &amp;nbsp;It better have all-wheel drive, armor plating, a flamethrower, and be driven by Robocop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Menu for the evening was primarily Buffalo Chicken Meatza (dark meat, stir-fried, store-bought sauce), with mozzarella,&amp;nbsp;parmesan and bleu cheeses. This went over well. &amp;nbsp;We also had some extra mozzarella, so I cooked bacon and made some dead-simple quesadillas from low-carb tortillas. &amp;nbsp;Cooked in the pan with a dash of olive oil (we didn't have a neutral one), they tasted like fucking pancakes. &amp;nbsp;Fuck you, Taco Bell.</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html'

thing I'm doing now&lt;/a&gt; is reducing my carbohydrate intake. &amp;nbsp;After a period of adjustment, I decided to reduce it even further. &amp;nbsp;It certainly has helped me loose weight without doing any exercise besides pacing when on the phone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though that isn't enough. &amp;nbsp;Resistance training is the missing piece. &amp;nbsp;A good man once said "If you're 6'2", and 215lbs or less, you don't need a weight loss program, you need a 'get strong enough to fight bears' program."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any rate, the low-carb approach is helping me discover all kinds of strange new feeding options. &amp;nbsp;One of which just came out of the oven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mix 2lbs of ground beef with two eggs, and whatever seasoning you like. &amp;nbsp;Spread it into a baking pan. &amp;nbsp;Cook at 450 for ten minutes. &amp;nbsp;Cover with sauce, cheese, pepperoni, whatever the fuck else you want (no potatoes I guess), broil it for like, 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meatza.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll call it a tentative success. &amp;nbsp;Which is good, because I was making it tonight as practice for the Football Festival this

mind</title><content type='html'>So far I'm setting no land speed records. &amp;nbsp;It took me a week to leave Virginia, and now it's looking like two weeks to leave Georgia. &amp;nbsp;Or is that two and three? &amp;nbsp;The luxury of having no deadlines: dates fade into unimportance, and you seek daily and seasonal&amp;nbsp;rhythms. &amp;nbsp;The Modern Nomad. &amp;nbsp;The Lazy Savage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My father's finally given me something of a deadline, though. &amp;nbsp;The closing on his new houseboat will be some time in March, and since he will almost certainly be in Sausalito around then, so should I, because I love him and love that he's getting a houseboat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right now I'm staying with Hiro, a friend from college. &amp;nbsp;He has convinced me to teach him and a couple of our common friends to play one of my hippy fiction games, &lt;a href="http://glyphpress.com/shock/"&gt;shock: social science fiction&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;Can't wait to see what awesome ideas they/we come up with. &amp;nbsp;That'll be this Saturday, and then I'll be travelling again as soon as Monday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At six hours of driving a day, that'll be about a week's travel. &amp;nbsp;Though I might like to stay an extra day here or there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My old bank's card expires in February, and they have no branches in California anyway, so I'll probably close my account before leaving Atlanta, and travel on my stomach, so to speak. &amp;nbsp;My new bank &amp;nbsp;failed to send me my card before I started traveling, and won't send it to a PO Box, and I really should have called them weeks ago to send it here, like I planned...but as it happens, I may not get it for a while yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At a bar recently, I mentioned to our server I was only passing through town. &amp;nbsp;"Oh!" she said. &amp;nbsp;"I can see the gears turning," I joked, "you're thinking 'So is he a serial killer, or...?'" &amp;nbsp;"Well, as long as you don't pay in cash," she laughed. &amp;nbsp;And then I did,&amp;nbsp;of course, and it looks like I will be paying for everything in cash for a while yet. &amp;nbsp;I knew it was a good idea to keep my security belt!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's hard enough to find single-month rentals when you're actually in the city where they're located. &amp;nbsp;I can't wait to start calling people in San Francisco today and say things like "Hello, I'd like to send you a check to hold a room open for me sight unseen for just the month of February. &amp;nbsp;I'm currently crossing the country Clampett-style and...hello? &amp;nbsp;Did you just drive into a tunnel?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;update&lt;/b&gt;: Half at Hiro's insistence, half of my own choosing, it's looking like I'll wait here for the card to be sent to me via my father. &amp;nbsp;So another two weeks in Atlanta, perhaps.</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html'

A few whites, including a cotton polo shirt.  I was some kind of security personell at an embassy or similar estate.  I was suddenly embarrassed, looking at my clothes, realizing how chintzy they and I looked, compared to the people I lived with/was employed by/basically owed my purpose in life to.  Not that they held it against me, but why was I being such an asshole to them?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty basic stuff: I long to be as rough and tumble as I idealize my father to be (he's the only person I've ever seen wash clothes in a sink), or even more so, but this causes friction between us, since we differ on what good manners requires of us, and I am ashamed of how I don't feel capable of being someone he can have unalloyed pride in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Japanese say that the first dream of the new year is lucky if it contains hawks, eggplants, or mount fuji.  The Japanese, apparently, have really fucking boring dreams.  Who gives a shit what you see?  The interesting thing is always who you get to be.  (He said, trying to make an elegant point about his own motivations to have a motile identity, constantly shifting to the better, though he was too tired to allude to the point, and simply stated it flat.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday (for it is tomorrow), I said "good bye" and "I'm sorry" to my father, and drove here from Miami.  Along the way, I saw a cloud of buzzards so large that I was forced to re-estimate how many buzzards there are in the world.  To look into their swirling number was to invite madness.  So I did, of course.  But I didn't have my camera, of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to a late start, and a relaxed driving pace, I passed the arbitrary turning point of the year-increment standing outside the locked door of an apparently empty hotel lobby, wondering what from my car would be the most polite object to use as a crowbar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first time in memory I've been alone on New Year's Eve.  I would usually be with my mother, who would be with her mother, the whole matrioshka set of us.  But they both died this year, so here I am in Waterboro, driving to DC, there to collect all of my worldly possessions that can fit in my Jetta station wagon, then to drive them to San Francisco, because goddammit that's what I decided that I would do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More to follow, because it's easier to post the illucid details for all the world to see than to send individual emails to all the people who say they want to know about what I'm doing.</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2011/01/that-new-self-smell.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/4604748886020486986'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/4604748886020486986'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2011/01/that-new-self-smell.html' title='That New Self Smell'/><author><name>Nick Novitski</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08863651199447917923</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total><georss:featurename>Walterboro, SC 29488, USA</georss:featurename><georss:point>32.9051704 -80.6667688</georss:point><georss:box>32.833109400000005 -80.7834983 32.9772314 -80.5500393</georss:box></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31707300.post-1272980175938725526</id><published>2010-11-15T18:19:00.001-05:00</published><updated>2010-11-15T22:09:49.180-05:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Love Race 3000</title><content type='html'>I got the chance, while in San Francisco recently, to see Red Line at the Viz Theatre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, if it didn't prominently feature a race called the red line,&lt;br /&gt;and a song about a red line in English , I would recommend that they&lt;br /&gt;release it here as Love Race 3000, because based on my direct&lt;br /&gt;experience, anything less subtle than that will have nerds saying shit&lt;br /&gt;like " that ending was stupid."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No spoilers: it's not stupid, it's exactly what 80% of the film was&lt;br /&gt;prefiguring, but I suspect it will prove a great sorting mechanism for&lt;br /&gt;the wrong type of geek.  "Your understanding of film and romantic&lt;br /&gt;activity must be at least this tall to ride."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I just feel this way because of an increased sensitivity I get in California, or specifically because the look the girl at the frozen yogurt counter was giving me, but it seemed very clear to me that Redline is a film that wants to get you excited to go out to do things, in pursuit of eventually doing someone.  Here we are, watching a film that dazzled our senses with images and sounds of a hyperkinetic retrotech million-mile-an-hour race, and the love interest is saying right to our faces, "I'm not like you idiots who just want to sit and watch!"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main character ("JP," possibly the most perfect protagonist name&lt;br /&gt;in all of anime history) is racing because she said that.  He doesn't&lt;br /&gt;want to be the best, he wants to follow her to where she's going.  He&lt;br /&gt;wants to be the man worthy of her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We've all seen anime where the protagonist's sexual desire is&lt;br /&gt;sublimates into some sport or magical dueling tradition or whatever&lt;br /&gt;else.  When these anime are for children, innocence and childish&lt;br /&gt;bullheadedness is lionized.  How great these kids are, that they&lt;br /&gt;remain children, innocent of the horrible truth about life: your&lt;br /&gt;desire for achievement and interpersonal dominance is eventually&lt;br /&gt;drained off into painful and meaningless expenditures of seed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When these anime are for adults (okay, I've seen at least one, maybe a&lt;br /&gt;short in robot carnival?), the characters are eunuchs, sacrificing&lt;br /&gt;their generative passion for power in some other sphere.  Sometimes&lt;br /&gt;this is explicitly called out as disturbing and crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Redline is the other way around.  The chase for the woman, or rather,&lt;br /&gt;the chase of men and women everywhere to cross the red line together,&lt;br /&gt;is celebrated.  Even the people who don't cross it in the film sweat&lt;br /&gt;and pant in post-coital satisfaction, less jealous than admiring of&lt;br /&gt;those who made it.  Millennium Actress all over again: the chase&lt;br /&gt;itself is fun, if you don't hate yourself or life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ah, I may have also been biased by watching the Satoshi Kon oeuvre on&lt;br /&gt;the occasion of his death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the film, the redline is a race that happens wherever it wants to.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn't ask permission.  (You know, LIKE LOVE GODDAMMIT). This&lt;br /&gt;year, it happens on Roboworld, a militarized planet that doesn't want&lt;br /&gt;people to see behind it's iron curtain, and which deploys a series of&lt;br /&gt;preposterous barriers to people who want to celebrate speed and life.&lt;br /&gt;I looked pretty closely, and I don't think they are America, just the&lt;br /&gt;forces for militarized conduct, who insist that the pride and&lt;br /&gt;prominence of the nation state is the highest aim, and who want you to&lt;br /&gt;Lie Back and Think of England rather than Fuck When You Feel Like It.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do have a super weapon, Red Herring, DBA Funky Boy.  I was a&lt;br /&gt;little sad that didn't go anyplace.  Though it did allow the line "Mr.&lt;br /&gt;President, we can't let Funky Boy destroy Roboworld!"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most characters participating in the race (except perhaps the five&lt;br /&gt;time cyber-champ) acts like they have their own show and career, and&lt;br /&gt;are only appearing in this movie as a favor to the producers, Wacky&lt;br /&gt;Racers style.  This illusion is heightened by one team actually having&lt;br /&gt;been in a too-short piece called Trava.  I wanted more of those&lt;br /&gt;characters, and here they are!  Now we just need a Gori-rider movie,&lt;br /&gt;and a Lynchman and Johnny Bouya 6 ep OVA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, another exception: I think one of the racing duos is just the&lt;br /&gt;director and lead artist or something.  Even they have a role to play&lt;br /&gt;in this grand drama.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cyber champ is actually the indictment of the Ash Eunuchum&lt;br /&gt;character I mentioned before.  He has gradually ceased to identify his&lt;br /&gt;car as a means to an end, an existence separate from himself.  Purity&lt;br /&gt;of purpose means he regards the real point of the exercise as a&lt;br /&gt;distraction.  He's the winner and that's that.  More and more robotic&lt;br /&gt;parts were added to him, until his head is shaped like an engine block&lt;br /&gt;and he mainlines his nitro.  Oh, and he calls himself the King of&lt;br /&gt;Kings and poses like a crucifix in his final form.

I wonder.&amp;nbsp; "What do I have the confidence to describe?"&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="p1"&gt;I didn't use to be so hesitant.&amp;nbsp; "A very hairy man," I told my mother once, "who writes very hairy comic books."&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="p1"&gt;When I was between colleges, I worked at a comic book store.&amp;nbsp; I had already read &lt;i&gt;Watchmen&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;V for Vendetta&lt;/i&gt;, of course, and heard the oral history of the &lt;i&gt;Swamp Thing&lt;/i&gt; relaunch.&amp;nbsp; While I was working there, the collected From Hell came out, which remains a sadly unvisited monument in the landscape of historical fiction, despite being a fucking masonic key to its landscape.&amp;nbsp; As well, his venture into having his own publishing line had just started: the perfectly titled "Americas Best Comics" line was dedicated to channeling comics from an alternate universe where superheroes had never been invented, and all comics were culturally sensitive and scientifically thoughtful re-launches of the Jungle Man, the Science Hero, the Strong Man, or all three, in the case of square-jawed flagship, &lt;i&gt;Tom Strong&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="p1"&gt;Americas Best Comics also published &lt;i&gt;Promethea&lt;/i&gt;, which is nothing less (perhaps nothing more) than a digestible primer of magic for the modern comics fan, which ends, in fact, with the eponymous heroine addressing the reader directly, asking them to pay attention, because life will be a test. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="p1"&gt;All these helped me understand him better, and more importantly, to sell him better.&amp;nbsp; But what really swayed me was something we did not sell: a spoken word album.&amp;nbsp; Alan Moore sounds like he looks, and he looks like a Nazorean Piltdown Man, who happened to go to a very rigorous but obscure college.&amp;nbsp; Alan Moore is what you get when Aleister Crowley gives up shocking people, has an open marriage, and (oh yes right there was something else what was it) takes up writing comic books.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="p1"&gt;But he isn’t a comic book author.&amp;nbsp; Or a writer of graphic novels.&amp;nbsp; If you look on his business card, it says right there, clear as day: &lt;i&gt;magician&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; And I knew this was not a joke, because that spoken word CD was, even to my doubting neo-masonic ears, a magic fucking spell.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="p1"&gt;If I say that some people believe in magic, it is like saying some people believe in Communism: the issue remains debatable, the claim adds nothing to your understanding.&amp;nbsp; But to say Alan Moore believes in magic is more like saying that Joseph Stalin believes in the Soviet Union: when you hear him talk, it takes shape behind your eyes, and you realize the iron inevitability of its existence.&amp;nbsp; In Alan Moore’s mind, the existence of magic is no more (or less!) controversial than the existence of the NASA space program: he feels no need to defend it, no need to advance it’s cause.&amp;nbsp; People who don’t believe in it are being pointlessly silly, and will either come around in the end, or won’t, no loss, to each their own, it’s a funny old world.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="p1"&gt;Alan Moore treats magic as if it continues to exist if you stop believing in it. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="p1"&gt;But why?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="p1"&gt;If you’d like to know the answer, you should &lt;a href="http://glycon.livejournal.com/13888.html"&gt;read this article&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; If you want to know why I, a reasonably intelligent person, think that he, an unreasonably intelligent one, is worth listening to on the subject, you should &lt;a href="http://glycon.livejournal.com/13888.html"&gt;read this article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="p1"&gt;It's an movingly impassioned and dizzingly erudite plea for reuniting magic with art, and art with magic.&amp;nbsp; The two disciplines (if they really are two) are repeatedly held up as distinct from religion and science, fields born from magic in their own way.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="p1"&gt;Moore claims that magic is an art of individual subjective experience, which remains inexplicable to science.&amp;nbsp; And claims it artfully enough to be worth reading, but there is a sadness to this kind of talk.&amp;nbsp; “Science can do many things, but it cannot account for X, which is my field’s particular domain!”&amp;nbsp; Well, you have named your terms, and bounded your achievements: your field’s irrelevance will begin on that day when science achieves a better understanding of X.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="p1"&gt;X has been many things over the years.&amp;nbsp; Celestial cycles.&amp;nbsp; The motions of life.&amp;nbsp; Ethics.&amp;nbsp; It is a few things today, most notably the full accounting of consciousness, which Moore seems to have seized on.&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;I remember in &lt;i&gt;Les Miserables &lt;/i&gt;(okay, in the trailer for the '98 film), Liam Neeson tells the Bishop, "I found that all that stood between me and not being hungry anymore was a pane of glass, so I broke it and ate my fill."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He is then forced to break rocks for ten years, and he does not starve, but that was more by luck than anything. &amp;nbsp;The only consequence he saw was the effort to break the glass! &amp;nbsp;There were, in fact, many more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But bread is a pretty serious thing. &amp;nbsp;When you don't have enough food to live, and you steal food from someone who does, but leave enough such that neither of you starve, most people will say "Well, death is worse than theft, so if there actually was no other option, then I guess it was the right thing."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These people have never weighed options in their lives. &amp;nbsp; There's no such thing as "no other option," there's only differences, sometimes large ones, in how viable options are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that's a digression. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, let me spin a completely hypothetical scenario: what if there was could not only steal something</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/3615229806571816116'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/3615229806571816116'/><author><name>Nick Novitski</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08863651199447917923</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31707300.post-1486877043620251711</id><published>2010-09-11T19:24:00.000-04:00</published><updated>2010-09-11T19:24:55.740-04:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='then I had some toast'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='fear'/><title type='text'>Currently Listening To</title><content type='html'>&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 13px;"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;n old Radiolab episode, "Words." &amp;nbsp;Convincing scientist argues correspondence between what we call "language" and what we call "thought." &amp;nbsp;Language isn't just a tool for cooperation, but also enables abstract relations. &amp;nbsp;Children of five years can't remember which corner of a room an object was left in based on the color of the walls, or describe it as being "to the right of the blue wall." Descartes was half-right: of course thought is not fundamental to existence, but language is fundamental to identity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I hear this, I am tearing through my mother's papers. &amp;nbsp;She wrote constantly. &amp;nbsp;Plans. &amp;nbsp;Idle thoughts. &amp;nbsp;Notes and reminders that she never re-read. &amp;nbsp;The rarest and most wonderful treats: letters that she didn't send, written for conscious communication, because they can actually be understood by another human being. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those we save, the rest is pulp. &amp;nbsp;It doesn't matter how much of her inheres in them, if it doesn't speak to the rest of us. &amp;nbsp;Half-illegible, whole-unorganized, they served a logical purpose for her in the writing, and an emotional purpose in the refusal to face their accumulation, refusal to abandon her past. &amp;nbsp;Like the rest of us Novitskis, she preferred to face forward and live positively, but regretted almost every decision, every home she abandoned, every friend she lost regular contact with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In what turned out to be our last month together, she said that her year-long struggle with her own deceased parents' belongings had changed her. &amp;nbsp;After a lifetime of becoming hurt and angry at our insistence of the clear uselessness of the shit that crammed the rooms and hallways of house in Miami, like so much plaque clogging her veins, now (she claimed) she was ready to let go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"I could clear out that house in a &lt;i&gt;month&lt;/i&gt;," she said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Yeah, we'll see," my father said, when I told him this. &amp;nbsp;We both laughed, but of course, we didn't see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We didn't see, and so I'm stuck, when remembering her now, remembering her as the person she had told me she no longer was. &amp;nbsp;Every time before, when my father and I tried to do what we are now doing, we knew that she would do nothing but get in the way. &amp;nbsp;Move herself physically to block our path, manipulate us emotionally to abandon the attempt. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"How could you throw this away," I can hear her exclaiming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"It's my math homework from the sixth grade."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Oh, you were such a smart kid, and Ms. Onorati knew it!"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"You don't need to keep this to remember that."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"You'll understand," she would frequently say to try to close the conversation, "when you're older."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll see.</content><link

If we were to draw music as a food web (and let's do), the things that people buy would be the autotrophs, the foundational organisms that don't need anything but the sun (or the human creative impulse) to grow. &amp;nbsp;Artists graze on these. &amp;nbsp;Publishers graze on them. &amp;nbsp;And then comes the final level, those hoping to be predators or parasites (functionally identical) on top of this edifice, scrambling as high up the trophic ladder as they can. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe they think they make it them strong or beautiful? &amp;nbsp;Large predators are often photogenic, and culturally identified with celebrated qualities. &amp;nbsp;They embody a cruel strength, that takes and does not see fit to give. &amp;nbsp;Like parasites, but with better presence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flourishing of corporations built on equally mad pyramid schemes - from the ones that send letters demanding out-of-court file sharing settlements to people concerning whom they had collected no evidence of file sharing, to the ones that collect patents so vaguely worded they might describe the powers of golden age super-heroes so that they can sue every market leader and their uncle on a regular basis - brings out the curmudgeon in me. &amp;nbsp;They can't last: there's too many links in the chain between them and the actual value. &amp;nbsp;Only one thing needs to change to invalidate their model, and they're all going to change. &amp;nbsp;They call it the trophic ladder because the higher you climb, the less stable it gets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it's time to found a vegetarianism when it comes to creative work, to avoid giving money to the highly complex publisher-organisms purely on principle, out of concerns for cruelty or sustainability, or even for reasons of mental health, if books on the NYT best-sellers list are found to be less nutritive than those we buy direct from the source.&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2010/08/pretort-and-bile-it-inspires.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/2046935157382886783'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/2046935157382886783'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2010/08/pretort-and-bile-it-inspires.html' title='Pretort, and bile it inspires'/><author><name>Nick Novitski</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08863651199447917923</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total><georss:featurename>San Francisco, CA, USA</georss:featurename><georss:point>37.75280111220671 -122.43507385253906</georss:point><georss:box>37.68493811220671 -122.55180335253907 37.820664112206714 -122.31834435253906</georss:box></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31707300.post-5620613286166764127</id><published>2010-08-12T03:39:00.001-04:00</published><updated>2010-08-12T03:41:34.244-04:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='journalism'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='fear'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='politics'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='neologism'/><title type='text'>What Open Source Warfare owes to Open Source Software, and why that debt will be repaid in blood</title><content type='html'>I'm happy to no longer be working for a government contractor, because it makes me more comfortable to post whatever falls under &lt;a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/typepad/rzYD/~3/BGZCBjJQ9J4/journal-open-source-warfare-and-ied-design-innovation.html"&gt;the ever-seeking eye of John Robb, OSW maven&lt;/a&gt;, which is in this case &lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2010/07/ff_roadside_bombs/all/1"&gt;an article in Wired about the IED countermeasure innovation gap&lt;/a&gt;.  As Johnny Mnemonic said, "When they think you're technical, go crude."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“I can take $600, go into a bazaar, and make a device,” says one senior Jieddo officer. “And I can tie up $1.2 billion to $2 billion of US money by doing it.”&lt;br /&gt;...&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Late one afternoon in April, Llamas shows me the latest device they’ve been working on, just in from Afghanistan. A neatly made plywood box about 8 inches high and 5 inches square, it has a length of replica detonation cord emerging from the base. Llamas pulls the box open, revealing a layer of soft foam and a wooden plunger attached to the lid. When stepped on or driven over, he says, the foam is compressed and the tip of the plunger, which is saturated with a chemical, descends into a chamber at the bottom of the box. That chamber contains a second substance, and when the two chemicals mix, a pyrotechnic reaction ignites the end of the detonation cord, which leads to an explosive charge.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The box is the logical conclusion of years of reverse evolution in insurgent weapons technology. Without a power source, a blasting cap, or a single piece of wire or metal contact, it has no electromagnetic or metallic signature. Linked to a charge mixed up from odorless homemade explosives, packed beneath a dirt road, it would be all but impossible to detect: a Flintstones land mine.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;img height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/typepad/rzYD/~4/BGZCBjJQ9J4" width="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I would say something like "this is the new nature of jihad heroism, to make a cheap and simple thing that will bring your inconceivably out-sized enemy low, to turn centuries of industrial development into a &lt;i&gt;disadvantage&lt;/i&gt;"...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;...I would say something like that, but only if I was living in an ivory tower that reached the mesosphere.  When was the last time heroism meant something else?  And what changed?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;About ten years ago, I read an article (perhaps even in Wired) that attempted to lay out the case for technology.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Don't laugh!  Many intelligent people can be made concerned by new devices that they feel enable behaviors that &lt;i&gt;even you&lt;/i&gt; would find distasteful, and hold the technological developments which enabled them guilty, as if they were the direct cause.  Telecommunications enables ubiquitous surveillance, so it's a sinister omnipresence.  Radio enables Microwave Area-Denial Weaponry, so it's a tool of bloodless oppression.  Ammonium nitrate enrichment enables cutting the beaks off factory farm chickens, so it's a font of cruelty, rather than a horn of plenty.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So, for those people, this article calmly explained why many folks feel that the benefits outweigh the drawbacks, or rather, that the old problems being solved outweigh the new ones being created.  Rather than enumerate each technogenic complication, in the classical style, a large number of them were gathered into a moderate number of types, raised as objections attributed to the opposite view, and serially dispatched.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Of these, the point that stood out to me, or at least that I still remember with unusual clarity, was that technology disproportionately benefits the rich.  New things, such as have never been seen before, cost too much even for most people in the first world, much less most of the world as a whole.  So all this internet stuff, for instance, is at best a waste of time, in humanitarian terms.  To quote a character from &lt;i&gt;Cryptonomicon&lt;/i&gt; (who, just to be clear, was being held up as an idiot): "How many schools will be torn down to build the information superhighway?"&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But that isn't the whole story, the article explained.  Technology benefits people who can't afford much, or even any of it.  When I visit cities where it snows, cheap salt production help me get around.  When I live in settlements with other humans, herd immunity protects me from Scarlet Fever.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Most of all: a lot of technological development, rather than making entirely new stuff, makes the stuff we already had much cheaper.  So all the brand new fancy things eventually become the tired old commonplaces that anyone can have if they want to, if they have a use for them.  Poor folks today have access to things the richest and most powerful people of long-since-past could not have, be it advanced metallurgy or instantaneous long-distance communication.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The author positioned technology not only as a net benefit to the global poor, but even as a &lt;i&gt;disproportionate &lt;/i&gt;benefit to them.  People with less benefit &lt;i&gt;more&lt;/i&gt; from these advances, relative to what they had before, compared to the rest of us, who just get a new toy to misunderstand, be distracted by, and eventually ignore as unfashionable.  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So a biologist might have said that rats benefited more from the Age of Sail than Europeans did, because after the humans went to all the trouble to build ships to search out new life and new markets, all the rats had to do was hitch a ride.  And like the biologist, the author meant to be even-handed, not patronizing.  "It's even better for you than for us, and man is it &lt;i&gt;great&lt;/i&gt; for us!" he cries.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"You yourself have said it," as Christ said when asked if he was the King of the Jews, at the climax of the great western terrorist monomyth.  Unless you enforce widespread technical illiteracy (extant techniques: patents, copyrights, reifications of "Consumers" and "Providers")  or provide widespread contentment, trickle-down technology will eventually empower the bottom of the pyramid to be right murderous bastards to you.  They're already used to going without; now they just need to cut you off, to make you go without, make you extend your reach in uncomfortable ways.  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In the Napoleonic metaphor, they live in Russian winter all the time, and all they need to do to win is to pull you in - or, if you're that stupid, to have you follow them in - rather than let you crouch in a bordering country lobbing cruise missiles at them (in which case neither you nor they win, but we'll see whether we can ever return to the blessed time of the US not needing to invade anything just to be as rich and powerful as we know we deserve to be).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;You were probably around back then, probably heard all that bombast of there being a new era coming, of ideas and ideals, the electronic frontier that would level all the steep and awful oppressions of the Old Ways?  It didn't work out that way, because though these prophets were doing all this complaining, were nearly professional complainers, &lt;i&gt;they had nothing to complain about &lt;/i&gt;(so the modern internet is their legacy in more ways than one).  The world wasn't going to change to the way they thought they wanted, because they didn't know from want.  They didn't know from need.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But I still congratulate them, because they paved the way for everyone else, and that some of these elses turn around and use their sophisticated free software &amp;amp; entertainment distribution systems to trade ideas on how to cause maximum property damage and loss of life, again and again, until their demands are met...well, that's what the prophets of information technology said they wanted!  Democratization, freedom, an end to the staid networks of power that they could feel pushing them into locker after locker, at their meaningless school, at their degrading job, with every good toy that got a warning label and every good show that Fox canceled.  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;What they (including I) wanted was trivial.  What they (meaning only they) have achieved is not: a burgeoning population hungry to take and use their every good idea.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;As an American, I'm contractually obligated to believe in some version of the second amendment (the Constitution is now muddling through its third century, and like Christianity in that stage of its life, heresies are flourishing).  I propose this perspective to other Americans: that people destroy our butter when we use our guns on them is a good thing, because it is the second amendment writ large across the face of the world.  Tyranny, even our own, becomes more and more expensive as technology develops.  Which is good!  Hegemony is tough, to say nothing of being morally fraught.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And this formulation should be recognizable to Open Source advocates.  Every advance of Linux raises the bar, next to which there is a sign which reads "Your product must be at least this good to compete" and another which says "Your product can be at least this good, for free."  The cost to &lt;u&gt;enter&lt;/u&gt; the market lowers, but the cost to &lt;u&gt;dominate&lt;/u&gt; the market raises.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Like an IED, no matter what you do with Linux, no matter how you refine it, it still follows its original purpose.  It still expresses the will which fed and animated its originating phenomenon, to the point that we needed an acronym for it.   They aren't "bombs," and it isn't "a Unix-like Operating System."  They are both a kind of ordinance aimed at the heart of overfunded, overextended competitors.  Easy targets, in other words.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Let the lessons of Open Source be two-fold: always celebrate the achievements of the like-minded, and never let yourself become an easy target.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Welcome to the future we wanted.&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2010/08/what-open-source-warfare-owes-to-open.html#comment-form' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/5620613286166764127'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/5620613286166764127'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2010/08/what-open-source-warfare-owes-to-open.html' title='What Open Source Warfare owes to Open Source Software, and why that debt will be repaid in blood'/><author><name>Nick Novitski</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08863651199447917923</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31707300.post-8847448040519468043</id><published>2010-06-15T13:06:00.001-04:00</published><updated>2010-06-15T13:43:06.578-04:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='gaming'/><title type='text'>Remember Tomorrow and game finishing school</title><content type='html'>I recently played Remember Tomorrow, a new game by Gregor Hutton, he of 3:16 fame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(3:16 is not a game that I have played, but I could, and I appreciate the structure of its design and its place in the fiction-plane defined by Starship Troopers, Warhammer 40,000, and Apocalypse Now. That's all academic, of course, but I've also heard people play it, and they all seemed to be having at least some fun.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I go any further, I feel I should qualify "played." In my opinion, the very first part of any game review should be to say exactly how long or how many times the reviewer has played the game. In the case of RPGs, where many people buy products just to signal their tastes and affiliations, without any serious expectation of using them in an actual game with actual people, the assumption is that a "review" will just give an impression based on reading it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a bit like reviewing a book by looking at the jacket, or maybe reviewing a movie by reading the screenplay. It's a bit like those things because it's a fundamentally incomplete experience, but it's not like those things in that it's quite common. I wouldn't mind it so much, so long as you could filter reviews based on whether people had played the game at all, and for how long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I did play this game, but not for very long. Not even for one full session. I think that's very important to admit, because though I was left with a positive impression, I had several very specific things I'd want to see changed. It's strange to have such pronounced and focused opinions without actually trying the damn thing out, but that may have been a consequence of presentation: the copy I had was assembled by one of my co-players, saddle-stapled pages with gaps and errors in the printing. A real throw-back. It looked like an ashcan, and then when I played it, I saw it as an ashcan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Funny, he and I used the word "ashcan," and the third person playing didn't know what that meant. So I'll say, it means a printing of an incomplete game you release for free or very cheap, to get playtesting, build excitement, possibly fund a print run.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And ashcans demand specific feedback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember Tomorrow has a structure that reminded me of shock: meets Universalis. Everyone takes turns establishing scenes. In their first scene of the first session, each player introduces a character that no one else can control, called the "held character." Characters all have a goal, a thing they really, really want to accomplish. In their second scene, they each introduce an organization, preferably one that hates all the characters. All organizations want to increase their power, represented by their single stat, influence. (subtle, I know)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After that, things go into a structured free-for-all. On your turn, you can either introduce yet another character (not a held one, so anyone can use or play as them) or group, you can have your held character make a deal with a group - which makes them more influential and gives your character the chance to improve their position (though not work towards their goal), or you can send a group or other character to fuck up another player's held character.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Put it this way: you&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should say that Remember Tomorrow has a rule for when you're supposed to stop playing; an episode ends when three entities (individuals or groups) have exited the fiction, whether by getting what they want most (in the case of individuals), moving up to a bigger playing field (groups only), or getting killed (anyone).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We didn't reach that point. In fact, we didn't have any exits. I got the impression that it could go on for a pretty shockingly long session. And I wasn't because of any slowness on our part&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The goal is to emulate an ensemble cast drama, but how many of those have three recurring characters either bite it or hit it big every episode?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What might help is making non-held characters more fragile. They can fight with&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hypothetically, people could just keep introducing new characters every turn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was intrigued by the&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Order of operations problem: it's a very big difference between declaring what your goal is before framing the scene, or after&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gear is my least favorite part of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No fictional results depending on rolls! I'd say that if you fail at each, there's some limitation on your narration. So if you fail ready, something unexpected happens and things go worse than you thought, and if you fail willing, you are given an opportunity that you don't take, and if you fail able...okay, not sure there.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/8847448040519468043'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml'

is that I don't have to spend much time describing it, but if you can't imagine why I'd be down on it, it's that it's a machine designed only to enable consumption. &amp;nbsp;You can't print from it. &amp;nbsp;You can't connect. &amp;nbsp;You can neither &lt;i&gt;create&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;nor &lt;i&gt;compute&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;to any degree I consider sufficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But! &amp;nbsp;You can buy books (just don't try to share or take notes in them)! &amp;nbsp;You can buy movies (just don't try to watch them in a group)! &amp;nbsp;You can buy all kinds of assorted programs (just don't try to make your own to share with your friends).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The iPad is like a portable version of a corporate info-kiosk. &amp;nbsp;You can do only what they'll let you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah. &amp;nbsp;I don't like TVs much either. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't tell me that I don't understand the appeal of the iPad. &amp;nbsp;I understand it perfectly! &amp;nbsp;I feel it keenly! &amp;nbsp;Neophiles like us don't just like new things, new stuff, new expensive objects, don't people want to live in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's a tenet we've tended to live by, that we can always benefit from re-stating:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Comport yourself as if you are a traveller from the

type='text'>Cybernetic Language</title><content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://www.examiner.com/x-16352-Japan-Headlines-Examiner~y2010m6d9-Kanji-for-common-use-count-increasing-to-meet-electronic-age"&gt;196 kanji are being added to the official list for common use (and five removed), due to a bunch of new objects being more common nowadays.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's how Japanese writing works (skip to the section break if you know this): there are two syllabaries - Hiragana and Kana, which are mostly interchangeable, though one is more frequently used for loan words from other languages - and one ideograph set - the Kanji, Chinese characters. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A syllabary is like an alphabet, except each mark corresponds to a syllable rather than a sound (or set of sounds, in English and similarly benighted tongues). &amp;nbsp;So there are "letters" that mean "na" and "bo" and "o" and "gu" and so forth. &amp;nbsp;There are a couple dozen, modified by diacritical marks and duplicated in the two systems. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ideographs are like hieroglyphics: symbols or images of varying levels of abstraction that have a specific meaning. &amp;nbsp;Three birds might mean summer. &amp;nbsp;A crocodile under water means danger. &amp;nbsp;So there are "words" that mean "five" and "boy" and "motion as a wave" and so forth. &amp;nbsp;Of course, these words are sometimes pronounced aloud, but unlike with alphabet or syllabary writing systems, their written form gives no clue as to how they're pronounced, and vice versa. &amp;nbsp;Thus, there are many different spoken languages in China that use the character set that the Japanese call Kanji, and everyone pronounces them differently. &amp;nbsp;In fact, most Kanji have at least two &lt;i&gt;completely&lt;/i&gt; different ways of pronunciation just in Japanese! &amp;nbsp;Imagine if the word for &lt;a href="http://www.thejapaneseconnection.com/free-kanji-symbols/63_kanji_symbol_baseball.htm"&gt;baseball&lt;/a&gt; could either be pronounced "baseball" or "coriander," and you're getting the idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These systems are not entirely separate: they feed into one another. &amp;nbsp;Every possible pronunciation of every Kanji can be spelled phonetically in Hiragana. &amp;nbsp;And that's how Japanese word processors were made to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So endeth that lesson. &amp;nbsp;People skipping may resume reading here, please.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No keyboard could contain all the Kanji. &amp;nbsp;There are a few thousand on the "official list for common use" alone, and tens of thousands of more specialized ones for engineering and religious rituals and more besides. &amp;nbsp;So instead, they have the Kana, which you use to type words phonetically. &amp;nbsp;And then the computer will guess what Kanji you're trying to type (if any), and present it to you as an drop-down option. &amp;nbsp;So you spell everything out, but the proper characters are inserted for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So to make it clear: before the first working Japanese word processor could be made, they had to, repeat, &lt;i&gt;had to&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;write an autocomplete function, and every single one after that has included it.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Without what we think of as the mixed luxury/drudge of as-you-type spell check, Kanji would be rapidly becoming a historical footnote, used only in newspapers no one reads and art that everyone patriotically appreciates but doesn't really understand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now, everyone know how to read Kanji, but no one has to write them. &amp;nbsp;Japanese folks are living in an age of &lt;b&gt;computer-mediated literacy&lt;/b&gt;, way beyond our problems of no one knowing how to spell "independent" correctly without an animated paper clip telling them.</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2010/06/cybernetic-language.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit'

morning. &amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://gmskarka.com/2010/05/04/transmedia-part-one/"&gt;Recent articles on transmedia properties&lt;/a&gt; sparked a decision to take up an&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/search/label/leviathan"&gt;an old idea&lt;/a&gt; ("settings" we sometimes call them, as if they were jewelry in which others string imaginative gems) I considered making into at least four very different games, stealing style from the recently discovered (by me) &lt;a href="http://www.rifters.com/real/shorts.htm"&gt;CC-licensed set of Peter Watts' novels&lt;/a&gt;, settling on a specific facet of the setting based on the continually bemusing &lt;a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/1/Harry_Potter_and_the_Methods_of_Rationality"&gt;Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;continuing to fail to make use of my favorite decision theory fable, the &lt;a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/3l/counterfactual_mugging/"&gt;Counterfactual Mugging&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;(Am I made of links? &amp;nbsp;Yes, and I'd argue that everyone else is too.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's a little over 2000 words. &amp;nbsp;False advertising! &amp;nbsp;But good effects. &amp;nbsp;Read it and tell me what I got wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;When whatever piece of furniture you chose out of the catalog to be a comms station - the prosaic and utilitarian video screen, the subtle and convincing potted plant, or perhaps you went with the cheapest option, the single pillar of cloudy diamond with four equidistant box speakers that sound like they just rolled off production at Menlo Park &amp;nbsp;- chimes in three ascending tones, the mark of a station broadcast, except you can't hear them coming from any of your neighbor's flats, through walls so transparent to sound they move beyond the level of "Budget Construction" to "Social Experiment," which means that it may only be going to &lt;i&gt;you personally&lt;/i&gt;, and then that voice, that illimitable voice comes through, filtered through the scratch and hiss of your box speakers (of course you have the cheapest one, we all did)...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do you remember what you were doing, the moment before?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hold that thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Stop me if you've heard this one," He says.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's no mistaking that voice. &amp;nbsp;When the stark absence of copyright law in Leviathan meets the burgeoning thicket of it back in the Well, only private communications and works in the global public domain make it over the fence. &amp;nbsp;Immigrants bring secondhand reports of the weird shit they try to rent you for entertainment nowadays, but we've mostly got a lot of Alice in Wonderland, and Moby Dick, and all the other English language literature Of A Certain Age. &amp;nbsp;There are new productions of them every year. &amp;nbsp;You've seen your share, when times were low, when you had nothing else to do. &amp;nbsp;You remember the Wizard of Oz, of the eponymous economic fable, the enormous djinn-head, furrowed brow floating above titanic voice floating above the sparking mists which...support it? &amp;nbsp;Compose it? &amp;nbsp;Is he so powerful that his mere presence and focus produce impossible and unearthly gases as side effects? &amp;nbsp;But no, he tells you to pay no attention to that curtain, which parts to reveal a kindly old man doing his best to ingratiate himself to you, explaining he only did what he had to do in order to teach everyone a valuable lesson.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This, too, is a lesson, so pay attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you hear this voice, you imagine that scene, reversed. &amp;nbsp;The kindly old man with hair just slightly too out of order to take seriously, with eyes that spark just slightly too much to dismiss altogether, sits on a crystalline throne, the same deep green complex matter that composes the entire room, the entire enormous fairy-tale castle. &amp;nbsp;"Pay no attention to that ominous hum," he says. &amp;nbsp;"I am definitely an entirely normal person who you trust, and do not feel threatened by. &amp;nbsp;Stop me if you've heard this one before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Let's make a bet. &amp;nbsp;I am going to flip a coin." &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is that part a joke? &amp;nbsp;Would He really bother with such an indulgence? &amp;nbsp;Of course, He could find or make as many coins as he wanted, and an equal number of arms to flip them, though in the regular course of His business there is no call for either coins or arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"I am going to flip a coin, and if it comes up heads, I will ask you to credit me ten kWh. &amp;nbsp;But if it comes up tails, I will credit you ten million kWh, but only if, had it been heads, you would have actually spotted me the ten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do you agree to these terms?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're an idiot, this is an insulting question: there's no down side, no reason not to take a fifty-fifty chance for ten million risking ten. &amp;nbsp;Simple algebra: there's 5 million minus five good reasons for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're me, your guts twist, because seeing the trap doesn't mean you can avoid it. &amp;nbsp;Based on the flip of a coin you've never seen, your context has already been determined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Excellent! &amp;nbsp;Please wait just a moment."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the silence, you imagine an unused factory leaping into action, rapid-extruding a coin of perfect balance, and tasking a waldo to flip it according to an algorithm that incorporates seven separate entropy pools from around the city, and three from welled parts. &amp;nbsp;The insanity you can understand, but the extravagance!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"What a shame: the result was heads. &amp;nbsp;So, will you give me those ten kWh? &amp;nbsp;I could always use the change!"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's where N paths diverge in a cognitive wood. &amp;nbsp;Some of you say fuck no, what point is there in giving you anything when no one ever gave me anything and I have plenty of things to spend it on and what the fuck are you talking about using the change when you've nearly got the energy market cornered along with air and food and access and all the other scarcities we poor little sapiens sapiens? &amp;nbsp;And some of say yes, hoping it can get you in His good graces, as if He's going to say "I was testing you, and you passed! &amp;nbsp;Be welcome to my hospitality, my new most trustworthy friend!"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well done, people who said yes. &amp;nbsp;That was the correct answer. &amp;nbsp;But only a few of you made it for the right reason, only a few of you saw the trap, in a flash of insight that left your blood flash-frozen in shock, your face slack, your legs rubbery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stop me if you've heard this one before: an intelligence superior to yours several thousand times quantitatively, and an unknowable (to you) degree qualitatively, and that has access to records of nearly every moment of your life, tells you He's going to do X if you "would have done" Y, then asks you if you're going to do Y.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How does He find out if you "would have done" something? &amp;nbsp;How does He _know_, for an absolute certainty, that you were going to give him those ten kWh?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He does what every intelligence does: He makes a model. &amp;nbsp;He imagines asking you this question, and imagines your response. &amp;nbsp;But what kind of model "would" a hundred square kilometers of artificial neural stratum make?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me return, now, to my first question: what were you doing the second before the broadcast? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You were in your flat, yes, we know that. &amp;nbsp;What were you doing there? &amp;nbsp;Just staring off into space? &amp;nbsp;One of those private reveries that take hold of everyone from time to time? &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Maybe you were looking out the window? &amp;nbsp;See anything interesting there?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don't remember. &amp;nbsp;You don't remember what you were doing. &amp;nbsp;You don't remember having any appointments. &amp;nbsp;You must have given yourself a day of rest, right? &amp;nbsp;The endless scramble wears on you, so you take a break to recharge, to not push yourself for one brief cycle, maybe to make your connections note your absence, that they may later be glad it was only temporary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't know you very well, yet, but I'm going to guess that doesn't sound like something you would do. &amp;nbsp;You're a lean and agile opportunist. &amp;nbsp;Of course, so's everyone in the City, but you close more deals then get closed on you, and you aren't just preying on the sad-sacks like some sharks do: you pick fights with the rich complacent gangs sinking into semi-stability, and you &lt;i&gt;win&lt;/i&gt;, almost every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, I said almost. &amp;nbsp;You've lost the past two times, even though you've forgotten them. &amp;nbsp;That doesn't sound like something you would do either, does it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can you see it, yet?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, when He spoke to you, He didn't pose you this coin-flipping head-scratcher. &amp;nbsp;He offered you a much more complicated and dangerous job, something that &amp;nbsp;that you &amp;nbsp;much more complicated to do. &amp;nbsp;He didn't openly present the alternatives. &amp;nbsp;He offered a reward, not merely in credits, but in access and discounts and the promise of future work. &amp;nbsp;You accepted, because the terms seemed like they had no downside. &amp;nbsp;You accepted, even though have strict rules about these sorts of things, even for station business, but your every concern was answered, and every reasonable demand was accepted. &amp;nbsp;You accepted, because everyone knows that while Leviathan always works to His own ends, He was created to make a level playing field, and part of that is He cannot possibly lie to anybody. &amp;nbsp;You accepted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't know the details of it. &amp;nbsp;You don't have to tell me, or anyone else. &amp;nbsp;If you don't, it'll be between you and Him until the dust of our falls into the sun. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do know that, at some point, the following things happened:&lt;br /&gt;* Something you didn't specifically plan for went wrong, but you covered it, because you are flexible and capable.&lt;br /&gt;* You were absolutely sure you were going to die, but you took steps to finish the job anyway, because you get annoyed at the idea of leaving something unfinished.&lt;br /&gt;* You saw an opportunity to leave the station with something worth much, much more than the job contract, but you didn't, because you like it here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How do I know all that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's go back to our third kind of coin-flip gambler, with the vertigo-inducing existential crisis. &amp;nbsp;Here's his problem: when Leviathan wants to know what someone would do, He makes a mental model of that person so precise and fully-featured, it's sentient. &amp;nbsp;So in my little analogy, He would dream up the gambler, and see what happens when the coin says tails. &amp;nbsp;So the gambler, who has no way to tell the difference, just might realize he has a fifty-fifty chance of being that model running in a simulation of a day-in-the-life, rather than the original person. &amp;nbsp;If he's the imago, then he just needs to give ten credits, and then his twin-of-less-debatable-reality gets the payout. &amp;nbsp;And so he hems and haws and maybe breaks down and cries, because he's either out ten kWh, or, &amp;nbsp;as soon as he announces his decision, the simulation, and his existence as a sentient hypothetical will come to an imperceptible end. &amp;nbsp;But eventually he says yes, because as he sees it, if he's going to die anyway, he has nothing to lose, and at least the poor sap on the outside (who he is in more of a position to empathize with than &lt;i&gt;any other theoretical person&lt;/i&gt;) can better or enjoy himself a bit more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's just one problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real gambler is dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imagos are tricky. &amp;nbsp;There's all kinds of gaps and surprises that can pop up from vagaries in neurochemistry that don't enter into models based on even the most ubiquitous surveillance. &amp;nbsp;But if you happen to get your hands on a legally dead corpse, brain stem intact, you can fill in all those blanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You're probably filling in a few blanks yourself right now. &amp;nbsp;Yeah, factories can assemble coins, or food, or potted plants that play music and news, and if you give them enough time, they can even make a new body. &amp;nbsp;Not a human one, of course, but close enough to run mostly human software, and better in some ways. &amp;nbsp;Faster. &amp;nbsp;More keyed in. &amp;nbsp;Just as smart,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You lost at least twice. &amp;nbsp;The second time, it wasn't your fault...hell, it wasn't necessarily a loss! &amp;nbsp;You just came to the attention of someone who had a great use for you, and they checked and saw, yes, you can be trusted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time, it went badly. &amp;nbsp;You died. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You're not cleared to know how it happened yet. &amp;nbsp;We wait to see people demonstrate dispassion and self-control in the field before we tell them exactly which hands were holding the knife. &amp;nbsp;If you're extremely lucky, you'll find out, and then get a job that targets them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it won't be a simulation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You've heard how Leviathan can't lie to people. &amp;nbsp;It's true, He can't. &amp;nbsp;That's why He made us. &amp;nbsp;We can lie, cheat, steal, and kill with the best of them. &amp;nbsp;Every time since that tinny little introductory video loop first told you about the Categorical Imperative that you've thought "but how can the system work like that?" &amp;nbsp;Now you know the answer. &amp;nbsp;Now you &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; the answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it goes both ways: He can't lie to people, so He made us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Us, He can lie to. &amp;nbsp;Us, He can simulate, re-simulate, splice and merge however He wants, however He needs, to find out what we'd do, how we'd react, how we'd manage. &amp;nbsp;We are his agents, his relatively independent extensions. &amp;nbsp;Flesh of his flesh. &amp;nbsp;Mind of his mind. &amp;nbsp;We are dispatched to things that offend His economic and aesthetic sensibilities, and then we resolve them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The coin came up tails, friend. &amp;nbsp;Welcome to the first day of the rest of your job.</content><link

class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Yun: skateboarding, baseball cap-wearing teenage kung-fu savant.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;It's true! &amp;nbsp;Even though there were multiple endearing characters in the game, Yun was my favorite. &amp;nbsp;He gave the impression of being incredibly easy-going, until the exact moment when he wasn't. &amp;nbsp;As the fight began, his normally relaxed posture would contort and coil into the steel spring you see above, and when his moves were unleashed, they were balletic in their needle-like precision in the application of force. &amp;nbsp;And the clothes! &amp;nbsp;You can't tell as much without his skateboard, but this guy was Hong Kong come to life, where the august traditions of history meet the vibrant energy of youth. &amp;nbsp;Everything hopeful and awesome about Asia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;James said that there was that one move of his that I liked the most, that I called "Movement Without Stepping."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's true! &amp;nbsp;Though by current standards my education in martial arts fiction had barely begun, I was already enough of a snob/enthusiast to feel as if I recognized the move in question: Yun (as pictured above) would throw a left straight while simultaneously pushing forward off his right foot to make a step/skip/leap that at the higher levels could cross the screen at speed (apparently, Yun's achilles tendon is the &lt;i&gt;strongest&lt;/i&gt; part of his body). &amp;nbsp;I forget where I got the name, but it seemed right; a paradoxical phrase seeming to refer to a logical impossibility, in fact referring to a flabber-ghasting level of physical development. &amp;nbsp;See also: the No-Shadow Kick, the Iron Vest, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saying all this, James further said "That's what I notice about you: you move, but you step too much."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needed a few moments to take that in before the conversation could continue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later, he asked me if I had any birthday resolutions (apparently, without discussing it, we had both thought it made more sense to consider ones own birthday as a "new year," rather than January first). &amp;nbsp;I said, "Yeah, to become independently wealthy."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So let's see how that goes.</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html'

type='text'>Pigeons Better Bayesians than Bayes</title><content type='html'>I've been wanting to write a post about the Monty Hall problem for a long while, and luckily, some stupid birds have given me a great excuse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps you've never heard of the Monty Hall problem? &amp;nbsp;So long ago, on the game show Let's Make A Deal, hosted by a man named Monty Hall, there was a recurring game where the contestants were given three doors to choose between. &amp;nbsp;Behind one was nothing. &amp;nbsp;Behind one was a new car. &amp;nbsp;Behind one was an old goat. &amp;nbsp;So Monty would invite the contestant to pick a door. &amp;nbsp;But then it gets unexpected. &amp;nbsp;After they had chosen a door, Monty would then open one of the doors they had &lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt; picked, showing them what was behind it. &amp;nbsp;Now there were two closed doors, one of which the contestant had indicated earlier. &amp;nbsp;And then Monty would ask if they wanted to stick with that door as their choice, or if they wanted to switch to the other one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That isn't the Monty Hall problem though. &amp;nbsp;I mean, some people call it that, but I don't. &amp;nbsp;I just call that "playing a particular game on Let's Make a Deal." &amp;nbsp;In my opinion, the real Monty Hall problem is how many people get the question wrong. &amp;nbsp;I mean, of course I did, but brilliant people did, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But you don't have to be like them. &amp;nbsp;Prepare to learn the secret!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm currently thinking of a number from 1 to a thousand. &amp;nbsp;If you can guess it, I'll give you five bucks. &amp;nbsp;Go ahead and say your guess aloud. &amp;nbsp;Okay, now, I admit that it's &lt;u&gt;either&lt;/u&gt; the number you said, or it's 218. &amp;nbsp;So of those two, which do you think it is now?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's enough said, I hope. &amp;nbsp;But&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Each pigeon was faced with three lit keys, one of which could be pecked for food. At the first peck, all three keys switched off and after a second, two came back on including the bird’s first choice. The computer, playing the part of Monty Hall, had selected one of the unpecked keys to deactivate. If the pigeon pecked the right key of the remaining two, it earned some grain. On the first day of testing, the pigeons switched on just a third of the trials. But after a month, all six birds switched almost every time, earning virtually the maximum grainy reward.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/6476115608497894513'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/6476115608497894513'/><author><name>Nick Novitski</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08863651199447917923</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31707300.post-8298745542397607287</id><published>2010-01-25T15:03:00.001-05:00</published><updated>2010-01-25T15:04:54.468-05:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Dear Charles Stross</title><content type='html'>[I didn't mean to turn public letter-writing into a thing. &amp;nbsp;Stross just happened to post something recently that really took me by surprise, and which circulated among my friends a bit. &amp;nbsp;I would have posted in the comment thread, but he closed it before I finished organizing my thoughts.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charlie Stross writing this&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Content producers who expect to be paid by end-users for access to their content are inevitably going to come into conflict with Google, because this restricts the number of end-users who will see the content, and hence contribute to Google's revenue stream.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You've lost me. &amp;nbsp;Google is going to ignore robots.txt commands? &amp;nbsp;Google is going to reverse their policy of not fighting advertisement-blocking extensions? &amp;nbsp;I understand the technological and market trends that concern you, but I don't think equating them with any particular company serves your argument well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Not all information is created equal, and the cost of compiling and producing something new is disproportionately high. I write books for a living, and take roughly 6-12 months per book.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you were almost any other author, I know what I would say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First I would say that after the Protestant Reformation, people built fewer Cathedrals too, but more folks made a living off of religion. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, I would say that we all want to make a comfortable living doing only what we enjoy, and isn't it a shame that it doesn't always turn out that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I would suggest stop wasting time feeling entitled, and start looking at either merchandising or serialized models of publishing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But you're you, so I have to reel in shock for a moment and consider things more closely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's true that finding and managing revenue streams besides selling books would eat into your time to write books, in the same way that finding and managing concert opportunities or merchandising stores eats into a musician's time to make music. &amp;nbsp;And if production of your style of books or music is particularly time-consuming or cathedral-like, then you're going to need money up front in order to live on your art. &amp;nbsp;This is why there exist specialists willing to grant funding, then attack the problem of making the principal back on commission, letting you focus on your art. &amp;nbsp;Nowadays these are called publishers (or managers or promoters), but what change are you imagining where there will no longer be people who try to make a living by figuring out how to make more money? &amp;nbsp;You aren't alone in your preferences: your market-segment is destined to be served. &amp;nbsp;Continue to announce what you're looking for - as well as actually looking for it - and a neo-publisher will rise to meet you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; Google runs on quantifiable data, and the one bit of data I can offer them is that as a data source, including all overheads, I cost on the order of one US cent per byte. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To Google's credit, they have a great deal of quantifiable data that proves your superiority to the average blog-spam that gets an equal number of hits. &amp;nbsp;First, you represent a "quality result," that people were actually looking for and/or are happy to find. &amp;nbsp;Second, you have a regular, demographically identifyiable Most importantly, when compared to any-old-blog-spam, it's obvious that people actually search for you, want to read your site, and want to repost or link to what you say. &amp;nbsp;Your most valuable mostly-quantifiable trait is doubtless your reputation, your social-central-node-ness. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's where you stand now, but consider all the regular hits that you have at this blog, many from people who treasure your opinion on a wide variety of subjects. &amp;nbsp;Any products which you recommend to them via link could have sales volume data tracked. &amp;nbsp;Any community of fans (or contributors or cultists or whatever you want to call them) which you created and fostered could have unique hits tracked, and which could grow and snowball in its own rights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But perhaps you don't like the idea of blog-ditch-digging, of hawking trinkets by the side of the info-freeway, of Home-Shopping-Networking it up. &amp;nbsp;In short, perhaps you are unyielding in your desire to not monetize your following. &amp;nbsp;In which case, too bad, because you're walking away from money, but then see the above: cafepress is to vanity presses what future "Community Consultants" will be to regular presses. &amp;nbsp;Look for them take care of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br

Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority</title><content type='html'>The Trip Planner on your website has been out of order every time I've checked it for the past several days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm not upset at this: I know that maintaining a complicated custom-built system like the Trip Planner is difficult, and that Metro is currently suffering a variety of budget and personnel crises which might reasonably monopolize the organization's attention. &amp;nbsp;And certainly, even in regular times, what state the WMATA web site is in should be low on the list of priorities, allowing you to focus your resources on moving we customers around in a safe and timely fashion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I am upset about is that an &amp;nbsp;incredible amounts of money was wasted on building that complicated custom-built system, when one the world's most popular and powerful transit-planing site, Google Transit, would do it for free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Between these outages and the many other limitations of your software when compared to Google Transit (no visual map, no mobile version, no drag and drop, no integrated search, vastly inferior user experience, and etc and etc until I lose patience in the listing), I cannot imagine a sensible reason for putting yourselves and your customers through all this grief. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I have had it suggested to me that the plan was to use your ownership of train schedule data to make money from selling direct access to it, and/or from selling advertising on the WMATA site. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a number of problems with this claim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First and most important: Metro is a publicly funded agency, created to serve transit needs in the Washington area. &amp;nbsp;Transit schedules, as factual information, cannot possibly be placed under copyright. &amp;nbsp;For Metro to attempt to restrict or "monetize" train and bus schedules is the height of bad faith and bad taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second: it is perfectly possible to create a customized, branded application, embedded in your own site, that uses Google Maps to find and display routes. &amp;nbsp;This means that the WMATA.com Trip Planner could be made better for minor additional outlay, and far less in maintenance costs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third: you have little reason to seek to drive traffic to your site. &amp;nbsp;Metro's web advertising revenue doubtless is and always will be minuscule when compared to customer purchases and funding from local governments. &amp;nbsp;Don't you receive both of those in proportion to how many people use your system? &amp;nbsp;Aren't people encouraged to use your system when they can actually find out how to get from A to B? &amp;nbsp;In fact, the cost of running a site like yours, with large images, static files, and embedded flash, greatly increases the more that it is used. &amp;nbsp;Recouping any appreciable fraction of these expenses through advertising is an unattainable pipe dream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm not the first person to send you a comment about this. &amp;nbsp;When your new site was first launched, I was one of the many people to send the suggestion to integrate with Google Transit. &amp;nbsp;I received a very pleasant response claiming that these talks were under way. &amp;nbsp;Some people who made this suggestion were told that your scheduling information was proprietary (as I've pointed out, an insulting thing to hear from a publicly funded agency). &amp;nbsp; Others were told it was not sufficiently accurate to distribute to Google (despite being accurate enough for the WMATA site itself). &amp;nbsp;Others were told formatting the data properly would be time consuming (valuable things often are).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, Brett Tyler announced that "forming a partnership with Google was not in our best interest from a business perspective." &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But we see this is par for the course. &amp;nbsp;What public response Metro has given on this issue has been, put briefly, embarrassing. &amp;nbsp;It either demonstrates a hidebound fear of loss of meaningless control, a ridiculous greed for paltry streams of revenue, or an incompetent misunderstanding of copyright law. &amp;nbsp;The consistent impression has been that either no one in authority at Metro is aware of any good reason to use the current system, or that what good reasons there are, if made public, will lead to justified outrage and derision on the part of lawmakers and customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Metro is now the last metropolitan light rail transit agency in America to not cooperate with Google Transit. &amp;nbsp;This is far from being the Washington area's worst disgrace, but it has to be one of the most easily fixed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please, stop wasting our money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please, stop shooting yourselves in the foot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please, start giving us the same level of trip planning service as is enjoyed in Boston, or LA, or any of the other four-hundred and thirty-nine cities currently participating in Google Transit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And please, don't tell me you need to find a new General Manager first. &amp;nbsp;That kind of pass-the-buck, CYA thinking doesn't fool anyone.</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html'

I want it to be clear that the below is meant to be funny. &amp;nbsp;If this article seems pedantic, incorrect, gormless, or insulting, that's me attempting to be funny.]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avatar is a new movie about a guy named Jake who gets to play the coolest video game in history. &amp;nbsp;It's the kind a lot of us have dreamt about. &amp;nbsp;You know, you're flying through this awesome terrain? &amp;nbsp;The very first and last things you see in the movie (counting the credits) is Jake having that same dream. &amp;nbsp;That's how you know it's important!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jake has done bad things and been in bad places. &amp;nbsp;He's seen action with the future-marines in future-Venezuela. &amp;nbsp;He speaks knowingly of what it's like to have the blood of children on your hands. &amp;nbsp;And he's been a paraplegic for a while, too. &amp;nbsp;This is the future, so they could cure that, but Jake's health care doesn't cover it. &amp;nbsp;You might say "But soldiers have government-provided healthcare! &amp;nbsp;Letting down veterans of the future-Venezuelan conflict makes the future-eagles cry!" &amp;nbsp;I'm not sure, but I think that these future-marines are either a trans-national mercenary company, or the "security arm" of a trans-national (and now trans-planetary!) minerals concern. &amp;nbsp;So who knows what kind of cut-rate plan they gave him?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So anyway, Jake killed kids, and had his spine broken, and was too poor to fix it, and had to live like that for an unknown amount of time. &amp;nbsp;It is safe to say that he has had more than a few nights where he wondered whether he should really be alive. &amp;nbsp;But he doesn't kill himself, because he is a good marine, which is to say that he is constitutionally unsuited to make decisions for himself. &amp;nbsp;Instead he suffers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is important. &amp;nbsp;White people are, on the whole, pretty bad folks. &amp;nbsp;The only way you can be a good white person is to have seen a genocide your culture has caused, and then sink into a pit of self-loathing as a result. &amp;nbsp;If the movie you are in is an action movie, then you have to have participated in that genocide. &amp;nbsp;It's just like in &lt;i&gt;The Last Samurai&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jake apparently didn't have any family at all, except for his twin, but smart and not-a-marine, brother, who died before the film starts. &amp;nbsp;We see him rolled into a furnace in a cardboard box, fueling Jake's rise to stardom. &amp;nbsp;James Cameron is there, telling Jake that his brother was going to be playing a video game for them, and it was really expensive to make, and they don't want to waste it, and Jake can play it if he wants, because DNA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jake dimly senses this is a chance to die without killing himself, or at least have his life not be the same lonely roll towards death day-in and day-out. &amp;nbsp;Of course, he cannot admit to suicidal thoughts, because those would be weak! &amp;nbsp;Jake hates to admit weakness -&amp;nbsp;he doesn't let people help him into and out of his wheelchair&amp;nbsp;- , perhaps because of a distant father-figure, or maybe his mother liked his smart brother. &amp;nbsp;So he instead projects pathological fearlessness, and he accepts James Cameron's offer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;James Cameron sends Jake to another planet, called Foreign Place. &amp;nbsp;Foreign Place is six years away from Earth (this is a clever reference: if parsecs can be a unit of time, then of course years can be a measure of distance). &amp;nbsp;This is very far away, and very expensive to go to, but the Company (it has an acronym, but who are we kidding?) wants to go there, because it has a lot of a very rare mineral called Money buried in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;This all takes place in the future, after &lt;i&gt;Terminator 3&lt;/i&gt; but before&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Aliens:&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;there are spaceships and power armor, but still no&amp;nbsp;robots. &amp;nbsp;Which is a shame! &amp;nbsp;They would come in real handy, because Foreign Place is pretty dangerous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;Foreign Place is the moon of a gas giant, like the forest moon of Endor. &amp;nbsp;It's got lower gravity than earth (Money is very light) so all of the designs of the plants and animals are inspired by underwater species from earth, or by really big versions of species in James Cameron's backyard, or, in one case, by the works of Leonardo da Vinci.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;The air is more dense there (Money counteracts the low gravity because Flux), but has less oxygen or something, because people can't breath it right. &amp;nbsp;It's kinda like &lt;i&gt;Total Recall&lt;/i&gt;, except it doesn't make your eyes stick out, you just pass out and die.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;Most importantly, Foreign Place is full of a bunch of animals that really want to kill you. &amp;nbsp;It's kinda like Skull Island in &lt;i&gt;King Kong&lt;/i&gt;, except the animals aren't ancient and degenerate; they're actually quite active and full of life! &amp;nbsp;They pursue their chosen careers with vim and vigor. &amp;nbsp;Many of these careers are predatory, or at least threatening. &amp;nbsp;They are all part of the super-awesome Foreign Place ecosystem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;I'll talk more about all this later, because the video game is pretty much all about this ecosystem stuff, but the most important part to know right now is that there are aliens on Foreign Place. &amp;nbsp;But not like, all the animals and plants and whatever are aliens, these are &lt;u&gt;actual&lt;/u&gt; aliens that can learn English and almost could be played by people in makeup, except they have three fingers (plus thumb) and are ten feet tall. &amp;nbsp;They've also got tails, big eyes, long incisors (set in surprisingly clean teeth) and flat noses, so they're pretty much blue furless space-cat-people like Panthro in&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;The Thundercats&lt;/i&gt;. &amp;nbsp;Oh, except they all have long hair in braids (poor Panthro!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;The scientists aren't dumb: they know it's pretty awesome how a completely alien world also has DNA-based life, but it's totally crazy that some of the inhabitants would be humanoid. &amp;nbsp;Parallel evolution has its limits! &amp;nbsp;Almost all the other animals you see have six-limbs. &amp;nbsp;I mean sure, you see a type of brachiator and two kinds of winged predators with four appendages, with the fore-arms splitting at the elbow, but what the hell kind of intermediary forms are those? &amp;nbsp;Wouldn't the space-cat ancestors of the space-cat-people just have slightly smaller middle limbs? &amp;nbsp;Wouldn't the space-cat-people themselves have tiny useless ones where their space-cat-breasts would be? &amp;nbsp;And another thing: almost all the animals seem to have separate breathing spiracles on their chests, and a mouth only for feeding. &amp;nbsp;But the cat people have one mouth on their heads for breathing and eating! &amp;nbsp;To say nothing of a nose (not a given on this planet)! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;They just figure it's kinda like how there were people in America but no apes: the space-cat-people evolved somewhere else and then spread all over Foreign Place. &amp;nbsp;There's a hole in this theory, and a better answer, but I'll talk about it later. &amp;nbsp;It is true, though, that they are spread out, so the space-cat-people that the Company is dealing with is only one tribe, that happens to live in a &lt;b&gt;huge &lt;/b&gt;space-tree on top of a really big deposit of Money. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;So since we have these DNA-based life-forms with astounding levels of similarity with human physiology who live on top of a mine of space-gelt, James Cameron had the totally obvious idea of making a video game where you control a hybrid body of human and space-cat-people called...dun dun dun dun...an avatar! &amp;nbsp;They look just like the space-cat-people, except they have a normal number of fingers, and clothing (oh yeah, space-cat-people are basically naked %100 of the time). He got Sigourney Weaver to set it up in Foreign Place and to write what looks like a really long, really boring book about it, which no one reads, because really, Jake can't even walk in real life, but he skips the tutorial and figures out how to play it just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;Oh right, so Sigourney Weaver had a bunch of scientists to play the game, including&amp;nbsp;Jake's brother (you remember he died), but now Jake shows up because DNA. &amp;nbsp;There, now you are caught up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;Oh, by the way: if you ever dreamt of seeing Sigourney Weaver as a lithe, ten-foot-tall cat lady, buddy, have I got a film to fit your unusually specific requirements. &amp;nbsp;Even Jake is impressed, and I think he got a lot of action back when he could feel below his waist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;So Jake starts playing the game, and it's really fun, because it lets him breath the air and be really tall, and run and jump and stuff; basically, forget all the problems in his life. &amp;nbsp;At the beginning, it's just a platform action game, because he loses his gun in a cut-scene. &amp;nbsp;Then he jumps off a waterfall to get away from a big predator thing that's after him, kinda like in &lt;i&gt;The Predator&lt;/i&gt;, except that it's a space-tiger instead of a real Predator, and then he's spotted by a space-cat-lady who's gonna shoot him with her curare-tipped arrrows (said arrows,by the way, are so awesomely huge they stop being elvish and become metal as heck). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;She knows about how scientist humans play the video game and run around studying stuff and building schools for the space-cat-people, but relations have soured between them recently, and the space-cat-people have been shooting their awesome arrows into the even more awesome bulldozers that the humans send out to dig for Money. &amp;nbsp;Because really, you gotta respect the earth. &amp;nbsp;So she figures she'll just&amp;nbsp;shoot him, but the Jellyfish Fairies stop her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;Okay, this part's important. &amp;nbsp;Since Foreign Place is right up next to it's system's gas giant, it's had way, way fewer meteoroid impacts and mass extinctions than Earth, which means that there's a lot more mutualism among the species that evolved there. &amp;nbsp;In fact, there's so much mutualism that there's a standard appendage that almost all fauna on the planet have - a flexible sheath for a bundle of prehensile axon-like fibers - for interfacing with one another, and with the planet-wide neural network, James Cameron. &amp;nbsp;It's kinda like &lt;i&gt;Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri&lt;/i&gt;, but instead of just a bunch of angry psychic worms, it's a bunch of trees in the director's imagination. &amp;nbsp;Because the space-cat-people have the biggest brains, they can connect to their mounts and tell them what to do. &amp;nbsp;They can also jack in to James Cameron directly and tell him to grow homes and food, and listen to old songs from him, and the wisdom of their ancestors, because they can upload their brains to him when they die. &amp;nbsp;He's like their Youtube, iTunes and Wikipedia combined, plus that other stuff, which I don't think there are websites for yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;So, do you remember when I said the scientists' theory that the space-cat-people evolved on some other part of the planet and emigrated to the money tree was flawed? &amp;nbsp;Well, it's obvious, right? &amp;nbsp;If they suddenly showed up in this place where their mounts (six-legged horses) and flying mounts (radical pteranodon-things) were living, there's no way that they would go to the effort of domesticating them when they could just catch and eat them. &amp;nbsp;It would be just like when people crossed the land-bridge to America and found acres of giant animals that didn't know humans could hunt the crap out of them. &amp;nbsp;Sure, it would have been great if some ancient indian had said "megafaunum, it's true that you're made of meat, but I'm so full already from eating the rest of your herd, I wonder if I could teach you to carry my wigwam or something." &amp;nbsp;That way when Europeans arrived, both cultures would have diseases to inflict on each other, and there'd apocalyptic population collapse in Europe and the survivors would start roaming the dispensing justice, or gathering in despotic city-states run by famous historical characters (if there are any Hollywood directors reading this, I have a great script for a movie about this).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;And there wasn't some kind of natural barrier nearby that they could only cross with the help of their mounts. &amp;nbsp;So obviously, they didn't evolve somewhere else, domesticate animals in a second place, and then move into their tree as a third place. &amp;nbsp;It is a conundrum! &amp;nbsp;But don't worry, the answer is coming soon, like a prize in the cereal box of my review, which I have to get back to now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;Anyway, the Jellyfish Fairies stop the princess (we find out later, she's the kid of the chief and the other lady chief), because James Cameron doesn't want Jake to get killed, because he knows that Jake is special. &amp;nbsp;Some of the other reviewers of this movie are all like "Shuh, cuz he's white," but that's dumb. &amp;nbsp;All the humans on the planet are white, except for one Indian (from India) scientist and Michelle Rodriguez. &amp;nbsp;But only a few people are playing the avatar video game and actually walking around with the space-cat-people. &amp;nbsp;Now you may say "Yeah, smarty pants well what about all the other genius peace-loving scientists that are trying to learn from one another and have a heart warming after-school wigwam special with the space-cat-people? &amp;nbsp;How come James Cameron thinks that Jake the crippled child-killer is such a good bet for keeping alive?" &amp;nbsp;The short answer is: he's a dumb marine who's had a terrible life that he wouldn't mind losing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;See, scientists have trained all their lives to discover stuff and publish it in papers, but they know that the other way to get famous (as a scientist, I mean, so I guess just to other scientists) is to find mistakes in papers. &amp;nbsp;So they're&amp;nbsp;always really afraid of someday writing or thinking something that other scientists won't like, or will mark them out as science-losers. &amp;nbsp;They call this fear "objectivity," or sometimes "proper distance."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;But Jake has no objectivity: he's honestly just happy to be playing the game, running around in a cool jungle and everything. &amp;nbsp;When the natives are like, okay, learn our ways now, he's not gonna be all "Oh man, I have to video tape everything, but still respect the culture of the wigwam, but still make sure none of my science buddies will laugh at me for being dumb and un-sciencey." &amp;nbsp;No way! &amp;nbsp;Instead he's gonna be all "You guys &lt;b&gt;live in&amp;nbsp;trees&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;and &lt;b&gt;ride psychic pteranodons&lt;/b&gt;. &amp;nbsp;That is the greatest thing. &amp;nbsp;I think I had a dream about it once." &amp;nbsp;James Cameron knows that if you give a guy with a crappy meaningless life an awesome action-packed life by comparison, that guy is gonna dive in, and then he's not going to want to give it up. &amp;nbsp;Just look at how people still won't shut up about &lt;i&gt;Terminator&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Aliens&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;So give James Cameron some credit: he's thinking ahead to when the humans are going to come after all the rest of the Money, and how they may mess up the ecology of Foreign Place just like how they did on future-Earth. &amp;nbsp;Think about it: Jake is the first person playing the avatar game who actually knows stuff about how the Company's industrialized military works! &amp;nbsp;He would make a great ally for inevitable war for survival (and he does, and it's totally sweet).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;But wait (okay, I'm finally revealing the big secret), how is it that there are space-cat-people that we can make avatars with and who have a culture recognizably like those of hunter-gatherers on Earth? &amp;nbsp;Duh! &amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;James Cameron made them evolve that way&lt;/i&gt;! &amp;nbsp;He knew about humans (possibly using planet-telepathy) and that they would eventually show up on Foreign Place to take all his Money, so he made the space-cat-people to be awesome and naked all the time. &amp;nbsp;Simple! &amp;nbsp;Bet you feel silly for not guessing that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;So it's not like Jake is being The Prophesised One Who Will Bring Peace or anything: he's just being used by James Cameron! &amp;nbsp;And really, that's a trend for Jake. &amp;nbsp;When the space-cat-people listen to the Jellyfish Fairies - oh, I forgot to explain:: Jellyfish Fairies are exactly what they sound like -&amp;nbsp;and let him chill in their tree and learn how they do their thing, Sigourney Weaver starts using him just so she can get back in the village and start studying their wigwams again. &amp;nbsp;And also, Sam Worthington (who, in a movie full of flying mountains and six-legged space-tigers, might just be the coolest thing there is) is all like "Hey, while you're at the We're All The Same In Here &lt;point at="" heart=""&gt; Store, could you pick me up some Plans To Best Kill These Natives and Take their Land?" &amp;nbsp;And Jake's all like "check and double check," because like I said, he's used to rolling with what comes, and lifting up his legs with his arms. &amp;nbsp;I mean, he probably would have been happy to have one job, and now boom, he's got three. &amp;nbsp;What a poor b-word.&lt;/point&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;Oh, and that's not all! &amp;nbsp;So I said the space-cat-people listen to the James Cameron's will as conveyed by the Jellyfish Fairies, but what &lt;i&gt;actually &lt;/i&gt;happens is the princess is all "Hey, this guy is an idiot, but he may be able to get us." &amp;nbsp;And then her mom is all like "Really. &amp;nbsp;Well, in that case, you should teach him everything about being one of us. &amp;nbsp;This will require you to feel responsible for him, and for him to depend on you. &amp;nbsp;You will spend almost all your time together, frequently in close physical proximity. &amp;nbsp;Any romance that develops from this, especially one that allows us to have a strategic marriage with the tiny space-gibbon-people encroaching on our land, will of course be &lt;u&gt;completely unexpected&lt;/u&gt;." &amp;nbsp;So he gets used by the princess' mom too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;I should mention, the princess' mom is the priest of the tree-tribe, called "the Lorax," who interprets the will of James Cameron. &amp;nbsp;She's played by Cch "I'm not sure how to write her first name" Pounder (what I said before about Sigourney Weaver as a space-cat-person goes double here). &amp;nbsp;Oh, and&amp;nbsp;I know I joked about Panthro before, but that was kinda insensitive, because just like with the Thundercats, some of the space-cat-people are black. &amp;nbsp;I know I said they were all blue, but you can still tell, because the C.C.H. "Seriously, I'm not trying to be insulting, but it's always written in allcaps fonts in TV show credits" Pounder cat-person has an even broader nose than usual (it covers up parts of her eyes!) and also, when she takes over the tribe (long story, hard fight, just war), suddenly they're much less Native American (whooping, jumping around, shooting arrows) and much more Native African (singing,&amp;nbsp;rhythmically&amp;nbsp;swaying, marching en masse to murder the white people).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;Okay, so Jake is hanging out with the space-cat-people, doing quests, levelling up. &amp;nbsp;Eventually, he finishes the quest chain for the flying mount, and gets to finally be an official space-cat-person. &amp;nbsp;Things are going great! &amp;nbsp;He even gets to sleep with&amp;nbsp;the princess, whose feelings match his own. &amp;nbsp;They do it in one of the tribe's sacred areas. &amp;nbsp;It's very tasteful. &amp;nbsp;But when she wakes up the next day, she is thrown out of Eden because the bulldozers are there knocking all the trees down! &amp;nbsp;Jake tries to stop them, because it never really occurred to him before that telling Sam Worthington about all this cool stuff about pteranodons could possibly have any negative consequences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;The space cat people are pissed. &amp;nbsp;Jake tries to share his expertise on how to fight tanks and gunships with guerrilla warfare (mostly, "don't"), but they think he's full of it. &amp;nbsp;They are non-industrial hunter gatherers, so as far as "war" goes, they are used to raids, threatening displays, and showing no fear. &amp;nbsp;So they do that, and Sam Worthington is all like "easy money," and blows up their tree. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;Things are bad for a while. &amp;nbsp;Jake and Sigourney Weaver and another guy (oh man I forgot about him, well, whatever, there's a lot of people in this movie) are logged out of the game and thrown in a very clean jail, and they have to get rescued by Michelle Rodriguez, who flies them away to the mountains where they can start playing again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;Oh, that's right, Michelle Rodriguez (!!) is in this movie! &amp;nbsp;She doesn't become a cat-person, but that is Okay in my book, I'll tell you that for free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;When Jake's logged in again, he knows that if he can't help the space-cat-people fight Sam Worthington, it's not worth living anymore. &amp;nbsp;So he gets his epic-level flying mount (it's like the regular, but bigger and red) by doing something completely crazy with an utter disregard for his own life. &amp;nbsp;He gets lucky. &amp;nbsp;The princess says that not a lot of space-cat-people have ever managed to get one (they're called Toraks, I remember because it sounds like Turok, like &lt;i&gt;Turok: Dinosaur Hunter&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;which is funny because they are dinosaurs and Jake hunts them). &amp;nbsp;But that's because Jake had nothing left to lose, and also he could think outside the box (the box is being sane).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I forgot, Jake is partly like this because he has lost his rock: Sigourney Weaver uploaded herself to the James Cameron hivemind earlier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;So now that the space-cat-people can see that Jake is really serious about helping them, and he says very politely "can I please join your war-party new chief (princess' father died) because I think I could help," then they let him come back, and he lets himself be used as a symbol for recruitment purposes, because Toraks are a big deal. &amp;nbsp;So soon the get all the other two tribes to join them in a huge fight against the Company. &amp;nbsp;Jake even prays to James Cameron, "yo, that lady you've got in there now can tell you that humans are a real big problem so you should probably send all the badass animals from your imagination to eat them," and he does!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;Some people said about this part "OMG, how come Jake can do all this stuff that the space-cat-people can't do themselves?!" &amp;nbsp;But as is obvious, Jake has expertise that he applies to the situation, and he helps them as a brother. &amp;nbsp;It's not like he ever becomes Chief. &amp;nbsp;That'd be ridiculous, and not like how these games always work: "Thanks a lot wandering hero for slaying the dragon and vanquishing the necromancer's horde and proving the mayor was a zombie and doing my laundry and delivering all those delicious meat pies, here's ten gold and plate boots you can't use." &amp;nbsp;I'd accept your vote in the election for new mayor, dummy! &amp;nbsp;But that's just how the world turns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;So up to this point, the game's been all action-explorer, kinda like &lt;i&gt;Legend of Zelda &lt;/i&gt;with the occasional gun, but for this last sequence, it's a timed mass battle, almost like &lt;i&gt;Dynasty Warriors&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;but with spaceships and guns and dinosaurs. &amp;nbsp;It's &lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;awesome&lt;/u&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;. &amp;nbsp;I won't spoil it; it's totally worth seeing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;Okay, I'll say this: I actually thought the future-marines were kinda lame, until they started gearing up and rolling out to put the kibosh on the space-cat-people's rebel alliance. &amp;nbsp;And Sam Worthington, &lt;b&gt;wow&lt;/b&gt;! &amp;nbsp;He stays so cool under such pressure, he is joining Forest Whitaker in&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Panic Room and&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;the Gruber Brothers from &lt;i&gt;Die Hard&lt;/i&gt; for my Top 3 (Grubers count as one, as I see it) Movie Villains That Could Have Won And I'd Be Totally Okay With It.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;In the very end, the princess has to save Jake's real body, which he's been neglecting. &amp;nbsp;He hasn't shaved or showered, and of course he has those tiny little useless legs hanging down, and for a second you're sure that after having lived with him in the video game for so long, and having just killed Sam Worthington with huge arrows, she's gonna be repulsed just a little, or at least hesitate. &amp;nbsp;But no, she recognizes him by his nature and tortured soul, and she cradles him in her enormous three-fingered hands, and she cries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;This is the point where I thought about how James Cameron forced Linda Hamilton to work out and learn how to dis- and re-assemble firearms blindfolded for &lt;i&gt;Terminator 2&lt;/i&gt;. &amp;nbsp;And then married her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;Empowered, amazonian women are great and sexy. &amp;nbsp;No one should be ashamed of admitting that preference...unless it rings a little false, because you're a notorious multi-millionaire control freak. &amp;nbsp;But then, we don't always let ourselves keep the things we want. &amp;nbsp;It's kinda like the Sith in &lt;i&gt;Star Wars&lt;/i&gt;: always two there are, an apprentice and a master, and a good apprentice has to grow and eventually kill his master, but he also has to do exactly what the master says all the time! &amp;nbsp;It is a paradox, just like the paradox of the human heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;I guess what I'm saying is, that was the moment when I realized I knew a little more about James Cameron than I really wanted to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;Anyway, then the movie's over, except that Jake records his final confessional, about how they force all the humans still alive to go back to Earth and never come back unless they figure out a cheap way to drop small asteroids on the planet and kill everything, and about how the Lorax told him a way to kill his real body and just live in the game as his avatar. &amp;nbsp;It's kinda like &lt;i&gt;The Matrix&lt;/i&gt;, except in reverse, or maybe inside-out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;It would have been nice to cut right there, but no, they have to reassure the babies in the audience: "don't worry, see, he woke up just fine, here's your bottle go back to sleep." &amp;nbsp;I don't really think it's important whether he passed through the James Cameron network unscathed; what really matters is that he made the decision for himself, even if it was what anyone would choose. &amp;nbsp;He&amp;nbsp;found a way to live in a recurring dream where everything was beautiful, and everything means something, you'd do it, right? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;I guess that's kinda why we go to movies in IMAX Digital Things-Fly-In-Your-Face 3D.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2009/12/review-james-camerons-avatar.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/1007036864890173156'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/1007036864890173156'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2009/12/review-james-camerons-avatar.html' title='Review: James Cameron&apos;s Avatar'/><author><name>Nick Novitski</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08863651199447917923</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31707300.post-6780531333218313595</id><published>2009-12-15T11:39:00.001-05:00</published><updated>2009-12-15T11:39:30.984-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Demystification starts at home</title><content type='html'>&lt;div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'&gt;&lt;p&gt;These endless reinventions of ridiculous anthropic theories makes my liberal arts blood boil.

That is, in the section on damage, healing and impairment, there's a brief talk about what the different levels of wounds "mean," but I was surprised to see no mechanical effect for different levels of "hp loss." That is, if you have taken more than half your max in wounds, you are "severely injured," but that in itself doesn't, say, add challenge dice to actions, or anything like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's possible that I just failed at reading comprehension, but I couldn't find anything on the subject in any of the books. But then it occurred to me: that's probably what critical wounds and conditions are for. If you manage to lose a fair number of hit points without taking any critical hits or getting your stress or exhaustion very high, then there's nothing wrong with you a little rest won't cure, so in what way would you be impaired? And anyway, who wants to count cards and calculate percentages and add problem dice as appropriate for every roll?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, some people, but that's what optional rules will be for. If I could think of an easy way of doing it, I'd be coming up with one already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I think that I won't be the only one in the world who will look for something that isn't there, and I think a note in that section on the fact that there are no inherent effects of having wounds beyond eventually getting ko'd would help. But maybe that would be pulling the veil back too far. :)</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/2170928732214031241'/><link

0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;At my college, we all attended classes in Ancient Greek. &amp;nbsp;I was lucky enough to be in the class taught by someone who had Ancient Greek as a specialty. &amp;nbsp;Actually, to all I found on the subject, he was one of the foremost experts on the subject in the world. &amp;nbsp;At the very least, were he not teaching a variety of courses at our bizarro-school, he would (in fact, he now is) instead be making a living purely from knowing what he was purporting to teach us. &amp;nbsp;He may have been the only teacher at the school of which this could truthfully be said, which may have been why his classes were so different from everyone else's.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px;

testing. &amp;nbsp;He encouraged us to study and remember as much grammar as we wanted, and felt interested in, but he never told us to, say, memorize a list of vocabulary words for a quiz the next day. &amp;nbsp;In fact, he strenuously objected to the very idea. &amp;nbsp;"To know Greek," he used to say, "is to know how to use a lexicon."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br

margin-top: 0px;"&gt;A lexicon is something like a dictionary, but the ways in which it differs are more important than the similarities. &amp;nbsp;Ancient Greek is a perfectly dead language, which means that the number of original texts written in it is necessarily finite and, as it happens, surprisingly small. &amp;nbsp;Scholars have been looking for and poring over all the works that they could find, but except for a technologically-assisted case a few years ago, there have been no new pieces found for many centuries. &amp;nbsp;So, a lexicon is an index to all the extant words: in its least-abridged form, it is a list of every word that we know was used in every work that we've found, and a list of every line where they were used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div

margin-top: 0px;"&gt;Ancient Greek, being dead, is never a language you'll be required to speak off the top of your head (although if you're going back in time and need someone who might be fluent, this teacher would have been just the guy), so you're never going to have to know&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;right now&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;what some arbitrary bit of it means, much less how to say something back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;So he taught us the current best-guess of how the letters were pronounced, and speed-walked us through the grammar (encouraging us to buy a convenient crib-book for it), and discussed obscure points of meaning and psychology whenever we asked him about them, but mostly rushed us to the point in the lesson plan where we could painfully begin guessing at the meaning of actual sections of actual texts written by actual greek people. &amp;nbsp;And once we had reached that point, it was smooth sailing: that's all we did, save for the mandated two essays a semester, and they could be about anything we wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;Because, to him, it was perfectly clear that gaining an appreciation of the subtleties of the original texts was the only purpose a Greek class could possibly have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;So that's why the article&amp;nbsp;suddenly led me to a&amp;nbsp;completely ridiculous idea: test-driven education.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;Test-driven development (TDD) is a way of making software that starts with writing stand-alongside software that says what your goals are, and automatically checks if they've been achieved: the "tests." &amp;nbsp;It's far from standard in dev circles, but has many standard-bearers there. &amp;nbsp;The claim is that it makes rapid, stable incremental development more obviously achievable. &amp;nbsp;When you're done, you know you're done, and when you're not done, you know what you still have to do, and whenever you change anything, you know if you've accidentally effd&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;One of the consequences of this approach is that you'll find out whether you can actually specify, with mathematical certainty, what constitutes "done." &amp;nbsp;If not, then you arguably don't actually know what you're trying to accomplish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;So when people say, "That's crazy, there are some things you can't test." &amp;nbsp;I would say, if you can't test them, then you shouldn't be charging for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='edit'

from his experiences during the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Civil_War"&gt;English Civil War&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;You've probably heard the aphorism about life being "nasty, brutish, and short" (woo oxford comma!), but one section that struck me ferociously was...well, here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=2oc6AAAAMAAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA81&amp;amp;ci=88%2C927%2C772%2C312&amp;amp;source=bookclip"&gt;&lt;img

/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is, no one person is so big and tough that they can't be killed while they sleep, or by some team of five other people. &amp;nbsp;That this was true in his life time, I feel I just have to take his word. &amp;nbsp;Has it changed? &amp;nbsp;Well, there's a good argument that technology disproportionately empowers individuals, especially individuals with good ideas. &amp;nbsp;But there's an even better argument that, in Hobbes' time, casual violence, even murder, was prevalent to a degree most internet citizens would find incomprehensible. &amp;nbsp;Warren Ellis (a expert on the subject if there ever was one, he said, rolling his eyes and smirking conspiratorially) once said that the person who wins a fight is not the stronger or faster, but the person most willing to permanently damage (not his words) another living, feeling human being. &amp;nbsp;So I think that when you find people whose lives have led them to be unhesitating in the distribution of violence, they'll go through people who hesitate like tissue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But no, that's probably romanticizing again. &amp;nbsp;You see, there's this meme in fiction&amp;nbsp;(and certain related political parties) where the opposite is true: where some people are just better than everyone else. &amp;nbsp;You see it all over the place, from the &lt;i&gt;Iliad&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;to &lt;i&gt;Die Hard&lt;/i&gt; to all the animoos there are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've been trained to see it as cool! &amp;nbsp;How terrible is that? &amp;nbsp;"Wouldn't it be great if some people could just take charge and run and jump and kill and there was nothing the norms could do about it?! &amp;nbsp;But no, it'd be okay, because, you see, they'd be more real and cool and interesting and morally invested than the people/objects they would practice their will on!" &amp;nbsp;I remember someone arguing for that interpretation of &lt;i&gt;Exalted&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;(an old favorite of mine) back&amp;nbsp;in the old days when I went to forums, and I felt mildly ill from it. &amp;nbsp;Well, sure, some games have characters that are fraught and challenged and &lt;i&gt;made to deserve&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;the gains they have, or else you're permitted to portray them as evil existences, and then it's gotta be okay that they can jump through buildings and be faster than a locomotive and whatever, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But anyway, I think that "superempowered,"&amp;nbsp;the word John Robb coined for the individuals and small groups who have far greater effect on large systems than you'd expect, is a good name for these people. &amp;nbsp;So mote it be!</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html'

type='text'>Dream: Disney Afternoon</title><content type='html'>&lt;i&gt;The problem with publishing dreams, especially lucid ones, is that they feel quite embarrasingly personal, &lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;even when they have seemingly nothing to do with events in my life&lt;/span&gt;. &amp;nbsp;I went back and forth on writing this one down.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's night time. &amp;nbsp;Someplace nice. &amp;nbsp;Up between a dark, cool body of water and a broad,&amp;nbsp;crenelated&amp;nbsp;manor. &amp;nbsp;A garden, with decorative plantings, pools. &amp;nbsp;A gathering of people. &amp;nbsp;A party? &amp;nbsp;Oddly high-end. &amp;nbsp;"I" know people here, though I wouldn't.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then someone "I" don't know, a figure in authority (can I tell by his gait?) . &amp;nbsp;A cone of silence descends&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The recording gives a name to the phenomenon, to people like "me,"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It reminded me a great deal of a trailer for a disney-kid-aged Fantastical Adventure. &amp;nbsp;"You too, outcast but appealing child, can be a spy/super-hero/vampire/whatever!"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I'm pulled away. &amp;nbsp;The concept of superempowered individuals distracts me, like always. &amp;nbsp;So there is a fight between two such. &amp;nbsp;I only see snatches of them...they're dressed for the party, leaping about, describing strange, stuttering arcs through the air, across the walls. &amp;nbsp;When they&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The motion is pure classic Disney. &amp;nbsp;I'm Mickey, the sorceror's apprentice, summoning up waves from the deep with overbroad gestures. &amp;nbsp;Shocked, the woman is hurled up, out of the pool to my left (back where I came). &amp;nbsp;She pools on the ground, silvery scales on a thematically appropriate dress, gasping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was about to start asking her questions her, but...there! &amp;nbsp;I almost missed it. &amp;nbsp;There's another influence present, else is in the pool,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ah, I think. &amp;nbsp;This is the diverging of the two paths. &amp;nbsp;Enhanced replayability. &amp;nbsp;I'm dreaming a visual novel! &amp;nbsp;Well, I&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Better, but what about these?" &amp;nbsp;She holds up her hands. &amp;nbsp;They're crippled, flattened like backwards mantis claws...digitigrade, maybe? &amp;nbsp;Is she stuck in some &lt;i&gt;The Howling&lt;/i&gt;-esque intermediary form? &amp;nbsp;Annoyed by my propensity to inflict deformities on a shade that's done me no wrong, I wake.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml'

type='text'>Old School of Hard Knocks</title><content type='html'>I've always been very fond of the Dark Sun setting books for Dungeon and Dragons. &amp;nbsp;They were the D&amp;amp;D equivalent of Chuck Berry records, causing imaginary Tolkeinian to complain about "that blasted noise."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Screw you, mental projection of simplistic moral fantasies! &amp;nbsp;Dark Sun's the &lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;keenest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;!"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But beware rose-tinted glasses. &amp;nbsp;Recently, as part of a personal quest to assemble a toolbox for playing the setting with the Solar System (see &lt;i&gt;The Shadow of Yesterday&lt;/i&gt;), I read &lt;i&gt;The Valley of Dust and Fire&lt;/i&gt;, a supplement that I had a temporary difficulty understanding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the middle of an immense sea of silt, which swallows the unwary and harbors horrific monsters, is an eternal sandstorm, which steals the breath and strips the flesh. &amp;nbsp;At the center of this storm is a ring of lava. &amp;nbsp;Only one traveler has ever seen it and lived to tell the tale. &amp;nbsp;The ring is miles across. &amp;nbsp;In the center of it, surrounded by walls as tall as mountains, there is an insular and xenophobic city, larger than any in the known world, so large that sectors of it may lay fallow and grow forested, the better for nobles to hunt in. &amp;nbsp;In the center of this city is a park, a garden, where no man enters, and no animal crawls or flies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There lives the Dragon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may seem strange to people unfamiliar to Dark Sun: unique among setting for a game called "Dungeon&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;s&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;and Dragon&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;s&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;," there is precisely one dragon in Dark Sun,&amp;nbsp;whom everyone calls "The." &amp;nbsp;His origin is unknown, though his existence is universally famed and feared. &amp;nbsp;He travels the wastes, and holds cities for ransom. &amp;nbsp;He is a twisted and terrible and impossibly powerful being. &amp;nbsp;"His is an absolute existence," as they say, and an inscrutable one. &amp;nbsp;Where did he come from? &amp;nbsp;What does do to fill the depressing hours of his empty life?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He is a deadly gem, and the book attempts to gives him a worthy setting: an implacably hostile and depressingly &lt;i&gt;unrewarding&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;home. &amp;nbsp;I&amp;nbsp;read nearly the entire book before I realized that at no point in the book was any reason given to actually, you know, &lt;b&gt;go to this horrible place&lt;/b&gt;. &amp;nbsp;Where are the plot hooks? &amp;nbsp;Where is the GM advice on how to weave interesting adventures about the fabled lost city of the Dragon?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I found the tiny section addressing this question, with three answers given.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;First, the characters could mistakenly believe that&amp;nbsp;the Valley is the utopian city of legend. Seeking out&amp;nbsp;a land of wealth and ease has sent many an explorer&amp;nbsp;off to adventure-just look at Marco Polo and&amp;nbsp;Christopher Columbus. The wild tales of the Orient&amp;nbsp;they heard helped inspire their journeys. Player&amp;nbsp;characters could decide all by themselves to seek out&amp;nbsp;the hidden city.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First reason: because they think that it's going to be a safe and blessed place. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except that, as the book throws in your face, it's not. &amp;nbsp;So even if you reach a city which is impossible to reach, everyone there is a backwards ancestor-worshipper that wants to whip you to death. &amp;nbsp;Served you right for dreaming, moron!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Characters ready to accept great risk in the hope&amp;nbsp;of rich reward might come across Galek Sandstrider's account and read of his journeys. Any&amp;nbsp;AD&amp;amp;D® game player worth his or her salt should&amp;nbsp;jump at the chance to explore what might be the&amp;nbsp;greatest treasury of knowledge and power in the entire&amp;nbsp;DARK SUN™ campaign world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second reason: Treasure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is, as the exhortation implies, the prototypical D&amp;amp;D story: the characters realize that a life of travel and violence can lead to rewards slightly disproportionate to its terrible risks (because the Dungeon Master will usually lean on the side of&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;killing all the heroes, since we presume he wants to keep playing the game with his friends), and they want those rewards because...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, some players, I'm sure, say more. &amp;nbsp;But the game does not expect you to give it a moment's thought: your character does this sort of thing because we're playing a game where your character does this. &amp;nbsp;How indie of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;Quick, think of great fictional characters motivated to quest into dungeons by their desire for treasure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Well, Indiana Jones wanted treasure because it belonged in a museum. &amp;nbsp;It's not gotten into, but I feel safe in presuming he wants the great art and sciences of ancient cultures to be in the common possession of all mankind (remember, he is a teacher).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's the American adventuring party from &lt;i&gt;The Mummy&lt;/i&gt;. &amp;nbsp;I love those guys. &amp;nbsp;They are a pack of Joneses. &amp;nbsp;They are rough and tumble, and they want to be rich, and they know that the whole world is out there waiting to get shot up and drop gold by their pure American-ness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What do these characters have in common? &amp;nbsp;They each have some place to go back to. &amp;nbsp;They have some safe and pleasant life somewhere which stands to be enriched by what they can find out in the hinterlands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peasants don't go adventuring. &amp;nbsp;That shit's for knights, nobles. &amp;nbsp;What's the use of treasure if you have no home where the social contract lets you count your gold in peace? &amp;nbsp;And anyway, what's the point of counting your gold in peace if you're an adventurer?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adventure, if you must, but there is no Princeton on Athas, no America, no peaceful place with luxury and ease and renown awaiting delivery of your spoils. &amp;nbsp;Traveling alone, unprovoked, to collect gold that, not to put too fine a point on it, you have no real way of holding onto...it's suicidal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of which...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;Lastly, very powerful characters might decide to&amp;nbsp;take a shot at the Dragon. Their research should&amp;nbsp;show that it frequently travels the silt, implying that&amp;nbsp;it maintains a lair in the wastes. Of course, destroying&amp;nbsp;the Dragon in its own demesne is &lt;b&gt;a herculean&amp;nbsp;and probably doomed task—, but your players can&amp;nbsp;find that out the hard way.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's dissect this: We're playing a game where combat presents a fun and interesting challenge, and the majority of character ink is spent describing how they interact with the fracas and melee. &amp;nbsp;And you're rewarded for fighting! &amp;nbsp;There's all these great deeds and monsters out there which you can only experience (fight) by leveling up (by fighting) and getting better gear (from fighting)! &amp;nbsp;The game is a series of progressively tactical challenges in a sea of semi-randomized tactical challenges punctuated by "story stuff."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's nothing wrong with that. &amp;nbsp;I would describe &lt;i&gt;Final Fantasy Tactics&lt;/i&gt;, one of the great games of our generation, with an identical sentence. &amp;nbsp;And millions of people, myself included, play &lt;i&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/i&gt;, questing and delving and heading off to defeat the Dark Lord in the High Tower in order to avert the Certain Doom over and over again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What the digital versions of this game-type have in common is a save and restart feature. &amp;nbsp;When you fail a map in &lt;i&gt;FFT&lt;/i&gt; or die in &lt;i&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/i&gt;, you lose nothing but time: either the time since you last saved, or the time it takes to fully recover from your death and resurrection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The same thing is true in Dungeons and Dragons, except that instead of losing minutes or hours, you're losing months. &amp;nbsp;How long would it take a group of players to successfully reach the levels required to realistically challenge the Dragon? &amp;nbsp;Years, easily. &amp;nbsp;This is a game people play for years. &amp;nbsp;With the same character. &amp;nbsp;Who is permanently destroyed by being killed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But by all means, let them find that out the hard way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These is the sort of thing that I think of when, say, &lt;a href="http://www.mobunited.com/mobunitedmedia/2009/10/19/rpgs-decline-of-friendshi/"&gt;Malcolm Sheppard talks about how anti-social modern games are&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;That there are people who actively seek these kinds of games, I will accept. &amp;nbsp;Different strokes. &amp;nbsp;But I am just not yet equipped, by experience or revelation, to distinguish the attraction of the old school from, say, when people who went to English boarding schools laugh and say "Ah yes, they certainly did beat the shit out of us, too right, what what?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ben bought a collection of the original Traveler recently, which is full of this sense that I get embarrassed when I read it, as if I were staring at someone with a disability. &amp;nbsp;It's as &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;as Jim led me to believe it would be.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2009/10/old-school-of-hard-knocks.html#comment-form' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/2688788138735862585'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/2688788138735862585'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2009/10/old-school-of-hard-knocks.html' title='Old School of Hard Knocks'/><author><name>Nick Novitski</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08863651199447917923</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31707300.post-4441279193858154694</id><published>2009-10-13T17:08:00.001-04:00</published><updated>2009-10-14T17:39:33.043-04:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Down the Rabbitwiki: Pat8722</title><content type='html'>I've heard the phenomenon described before. &amp;nbsp;"I started reading an article on Wikipedia, and it linked to another and another, and before I knew it, hours had passed!"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has finally happened to me. &amp;nbsp;Yesterday I clicked back to the site's front page, and noticed that "On this Day in History," &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Miracle_of_the_Sun"&gt;tens of thousands of people in rural Portugal saw the sun spin around&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm not sure exactly what prompted me to open &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:The_Miracle_of_the_Sun"&gt;the discussion page&lt;/a&gt;, beyond a sudden fear of being an internet-Eloi, knowing nothing of the blessed Morlocks laboring to bring me this treasured information source. &amp;nbsp; Logic and experience both tell me that Wikipedia articles are icebergs, or rather mountains, hiding behind a modest face the lengthy struggle of vast and occult forces. &amp;nbsp;I wanted my information to have a story! &amp;nbsp;Wikipedia as the farmer's market of the internet, minimal alienation (indeed, frequent identification) between producers and consumers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my first encounter with Pat, and the first step on a journey to&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pat's career as an editor began&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;amp;type=&amp;amp;user=Pat8722&amp;amp;page=&amp;amp;year=2005&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;tagfilter="&gt;December 15th 2005&lt;/a&gt;, and effectively ended &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Of course, the nature of Wikipedia makes it difficult or impossible to know whether he had&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;amp;target=Pat8722"&gt;Every single edit he made in his brief career&lt;/a&gt; can be viewed, searched, indexed, briefed, debriefed and numbered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When an anonymous editor asked why there seemed to be only pictures of the crowd, not the apparition itself, Pat claimed that the picture currently in the article did in fact show the miracle. &amp;nbsp;"You can see from the picture that the sun is darker than the light which it is radiating." &amp;nbsp;He continued: "To the best of my knowledge, the picture was not published until 1951. It would be reasonable to suppose there were other photos of the sun too, &lt;b&gt;but it may take years, and the fulfillment of the message, before they are finally published&lt;/b&gt;."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"I am pleased that Arbcom has agreed to take this case, and I thank you for it. I have briefly reviewed the accusations at Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Pat8722/Evidence, and I believe that I will conclusively demonstrate for Arbcom that I properly understood and have followed all wikipedia policy, and that my accusers have not, and that the admins who blocked me should either be stripped of the admin power (if they have been blocking others, also, without policy basis) or admonished not to do it again (if they have not been using the admin power for political purposes consistently). There are many important issues raised on the talk pages in my defense that go the credibility of Wikipedia. Unfortunately, &lt;b&gt;I am presently involved in six court cases as a pro se litigant&lt;/b&gt; (meaning I represent myself - no attorney), one of which is facing a jurisdictional deadline for a petition for review with the state supreme court, and four of which are at the state court lower appellate level, also facing demanding deadlines, and one of which is in the discovery phase in the trial court, which the trial judge refuses to place on hold while I attend to the matters under appeal. Those cases can't be set aside, and are presently absorbing 150% of my time, if that were possible. Because I understand the importance of Wikipedia, I had been editing on Sundays, but the demands on my time are such that they are now even absorbing my Sunday time. I would like Arbcom to put this matter on hold until my apellate court cases are resolved (probably months). I would agree to notify Arbcom when my appeals in the state courts are over (or federal court, if that's where they lead). I would agree not to edit Wikipedia in the interim. If Arbcom does not put this matter on hold, I will be unable to participate in my own defense (i.e. unable to point out the relevant facts and show I applied the applicable policies.) I believe I will certainly be vindicated by Arbcom if I am allowed to particpate in my own defense, and that the admins who have been blocking me will likely be stripped of the admin power. I am expecting the best of Arbcom, because without it, wikipedia is going to lose all hopes for credibility. I am expecting that this is the point where a "due process" review is had, and as understood for centuries, means the right to have stated the accusations against oneself, in terms of citations to facts and citations to the policies the acts allegedly violate, the right to present one's own defense (which means the opportunity (time) in which to do so) in terms of citing fact and demonstrating that the applicable policies were followed, and, finally, to be presented with a concusion reached by jurors (you) based upon a stated reasoned application of the policies, to the facts as determined by you. I will check back in with Wikipedia today and next Sunday, hoping that you have agreed to place this matter on "hold", until I have time to particpate.

Example of Atheism</title><content type='html'>The most common definitions for atheism I hear is along the lines of "confidence in the non-existence of a creator deity."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A more accurate simple definition would be "confidence in the lack of immediate, day-to-day significance of a creator deity." &amp;nbsp;That is, if you believe that there is something mysterious and magical "out there," but that no one religion has a special line on it, or that or that it's not moved by prayers, then welcome to Atheismville, population y'all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Killing The Buddha is unsurprisingly full of examples, &lt;a href="http://killingthebuddha.com/mag/confession/why-i-dont-pray/"&gt;one of which&lt;/a&gt; was posted today, sparking my outburst.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dogs in the Vineyard players will know what I'm talking about, but it's not an uncommon meaning among the reformation and revival churches; they realized that most Catholics didn't really, you know &lt;i&gt;believe&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;believe in YHVH. &amp;nbsp;They just believed in the Church (idolatry) or the power of Christ and the saints (also idolatry, though we free-thinking folks call it "polytheism" nowadays). &amp;nbsp;This is how we talked at Sunday school and bible studies in my good old country home, Riviera Presbyterian.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But beyond disputations between accepted, original, common and real original true definitions, there's a practical argument: it's just a very short step from thinking "people can be moral or immoral, and still follow the tenets of any or no religion" or "God is a diffuse inhuman omnipresence" to saying...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, you either have made that step or you haven't. &amp;nbsp;A speaker at St. Johns once compared process theology (that is, wrestling with the concept of God being both omnipotent and "good") to treading water in a pool: you can stop struggling any time you like by climbing up a number of ladders. &amp;nbsp;Some people find the "well I guess the human definition of good is incorrect" ladder, and some reach the "this God idea isn't helping me any, is it" one. &amp;nbsp;But both seem like cop-outs when you're in the pool. &amp;nbsp;Sunk cost fallacy. &amp;nbsp;"I've come this far," you shout. &amp;nbsp;"Why stop now?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you're in the pool, it seems to contain all struggle, all meaning and value. &amp;nbsp;When you're out of it, it seems like a sideshow, a distraction from the rest of the world, an exercise that you might be glad to have done but you're probably glad to have done with. &amp;nbsp;As for which is the correct perspective, the rationalist in me can only say:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit. &amp;nbsp;A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.&amp;nbsp;Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.&amp;nbsp;Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: right;"&gt;KJV,

I have read it before, and I was reading it again today, when I was greatly inspired by the following bit, which I think requires no context.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;I slipped the key into the padlock and snapped it open. I pulled the tool shed door slightly ajar and turned to the cop.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"What's in here... don't freak out or anything. I collect things. It's a hobby, that's all. And as far as I know, there's nothing illegal here."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Though you could say some of it is, uh, imported.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Could you go ahead and step back, Sir?"&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;I stepped back. The cop opened the little shed and stabbed the darkness with a flashlight beam.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;I held my breath. He went right to the floor with the light, where a body would be, I guess. He spotlighted my lawnmower. Just a little push mower, Briggs and Stratton. A crust of grass on the wheels.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Then he flicked the flashlight beam to the set of metal shelves along the back and side walls of the toolshed. The beam hit a glass jar the size of a can of paint and illuminated the murky liquid inside.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Officer Franky Burgess stared at it, waiting for his brain to register what he was seeing. Eventually he would figure out it was a late-term fetus, a head the size of a fist, its eyes closed. It had no arms or legs. Its torso had been replaced by a jointed mechanical apparatus that hooked around to a point like the tail of a Seahorse.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;I manufactured a chuckle and said, "Heh, uh, I got that off ebay. It's a, uh, prop from a movie."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The cop glanced at me. I glanced away.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;He shined his light back onto the shelf. Next to the jar was an ant farm, a children's toy made of two panes of glass with a half-inch layer of sand in between. A colony of ants lived inside and you could watch them make tunnels and lay eggs and scurry around. On this particular ant farm, the tunnels had been dug neatly to spell out the word "HELP."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Next to that was my old XBox, the cables wrapped around it.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;He moved the light down a foot, to the shelf below. He passed over a stack of old magazines, not noticing that the top one was an issue of Time depicting a swarm of Secret Service agents around a dead Bill Clinton, the words "WHO DID IT?" blasting across the picture in red.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Next to the magazines was a stuffed red "Tickle Me Elmo" doll, the fur faded with dust. At the moment the light hit it, its sound box crackled to life and in a cartoony voice it said, "Ha ha ha! Five point six inches erect!"&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Franky stared at it in puzzlement for several seconds.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"It's, uh, broken," I said, finally.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Franky the cop inched the beam to the next object, a human skull with a single thorn-like protrusion of bone from the middle of the forehead, about the length of a finger and sharpened to a needle point.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;He went to the next object and again stopped for much too long for comfort. It was a 38 caliber stainless steel revolver. This one wasn't going to get used in the commission of any crime, though, as the barrel ended it a twisted lump of molten metal that looked like chewed bubble gum.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Next to it was a mason jar containing a twisted, purple tongue suspended in clear liquid. Next to it was a duplicate jar, only with two human eyes floating side by side, trailing a tangled tail of nerves and blood vessels. The cop didn't notice that when the beam swept past the jar, the eyes turned to follow it. Next to the jars was an old battery from my truck, matted with smears of black grime. Where do you throw away one of those things?&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, just to confirm what you already suspect: at no time in the original novel or what has been released of the sequel, has any of this stuff been explained, introduced or, indeed, referred to.&amp;nbsp; Each of these items clearly could have any number of zany and mind-blowing stories associated with it, but we're just given a tiny glimpse into Dave's world via the simple descriptions of the items and our own imaginations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was a young adult, I used to love this show called &lt;i&gt;Eerie, Indiana&lt;/i&gt;, about a big city kid named Marshall who doesn't understand why he can't convince his parents that their new home in seemingly-quiet, seemingly-boring (wait for it...) Eerie, Indiana is in fact the weirdest place in the entire world.&amp;nbsp; Marshall - who, by the way, predated Fox Mulder (that robotic simp) by two years - had a tree house, and in the tree house there was a cabinet, and into the cabinet he would place "evidence": frequently, the one item that could serve as a reminder of the zany events that had ensued in a given episode. &amp;nbsp;This cabinet would be opened at least once every episode, and was full of both the signs of previous episodes, as well as much unexplained junk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remember also, how the &lt;i&gt;Young Indiana Jones Adventures&lt;/i&gt; sometimes used the framing device of Old Indy saying something to the effect of "Ah yes, I remember that adventure quite well..." and off it would go.&amp;nbsp; And for that matter, how about that awesome warehouse at the end of &lt;i&gt;Raiders of the Lost Ark&lt;/i&gt;?&amp;nbsp; How many movies worth of crazy crap was hidden in all those other non-arked boxes?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And also, though I can't remember it clearly, I feel that at least some Sherlock Holmes adventures have involved or begun with Watson asking Holmes to explain a strange article lying about the great detective's study.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this idea of a Cabinet of Curiosities that the hero keeps and uses to either remind us of his adventures, or introduce us to them, or just evocatively allude to them, seems to be a recurring trope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, to change tack only slightly, let's talk about Oracles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently, there's been some talk in the RPG Design Community over the idea of moving away from providing the players with Tolkeinien descriptions of vast worlds with histories of arbitrary detail, and towards giving the players tools that assist (and force) them to make their own setting, in line with and appropriate to your game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Typically, games that allow vast setting customization didn't provide many guidelines.&amp;nbsp; Their systems might be almost entirely setting agnostic, like &lt;a href="http://www.dog-eared-designs.com/games.html"&gt;Prime Time Adventures&lt;/a&gt;, where all that's definitely required is Characters with Issues.&amp;nbsp; Or they might only require a particular social pressure or configuration that could map to any particulars, like &lt;a href="http://www.halfmeme.com/master.html"&gt;My Life with Master&lt;/a&gt;'s need for the tension between serving the Master and becoming able to love, or &lt;a href="http://www.sorcerer-rpg.com/"&gt;Sorceror&lt;/a&gt;'s tension between the characters and their "demons" (which could actually be drugs or emotions or fighter-jets or special kung-fu techniques or anything that grants Power but demands a Need). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So an Oracle is a way to give players a setting that they still create themselves.&amp;nbsp; Paradoxical, I know. The best example of this technique that I've personally seen is found in &lt;a href="http://www.lumpley.com/wicked.html"&gt;In a Wicked Age&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the beginning of each session, the group chooses an Oracle: Blood &amp;amp; Sex, God-kings of War, the Unquiet Past or Nest of Vipers.&amp;nbsp; Each tends to produce situtations like you'd think from their name.&amp;nbsp; Then each player draws a card from a normal deck of fifty-two and consults the appropriate chart in the book (but those following at home can use the &lt;a href="http://www.lumpley.com/oracle/4oracles.php"&gt;online oracles&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example, three people who felt in the mood for "the Unquiet Past" might draw and read:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;The 2 of Clubs&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;i&gt;"A scholar and antiquarian, unmindful of danger."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Queen of Diamonds&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;i&gt;"The fey and unfriendly guardians of an enchanted glade."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Jack of Diamonds&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;i&gt;"A murderer-for-hire, luckless and in poverty, from whom the gods have turned their faces."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Each player can now choose a character referred to by the oracle to play for this session.&amp;nbsp; Obvious possibilities include the Scholar, the murderer, or one of the glade-guardians.&amp;nbsp; Each of these, by the nature of their description, imply an adventure involving the unquiet past: the scholar will seek out old and dangerous things, like perhaps the unknown power of the glade, but where does the murderer come in, and what did he do that caused the world to turn against him?&amp;nbsp; Penetrate and pollute the glade?&amp;nbsp; Has he been hired by the scholar due to his expertise in these matters?&amp;nbsp; What will he be willing to do to regain the favor of the gods, or wealth, or death or whatever it is he craves?&amp;nbsp; And so on, and so on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;In a Wicked Age&lt;/i&gt; is designed for long-term play: this process is repeated over and over, with some characters earning the right to re-appear.&amp;nbsp; The result is an inter-woven tapestry of tales unique to the group, but incorporating and reinforcing those same key events, steering the whole she-bang right into the thematic territory that the designer wanted for his game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my obvious point is, there should totally be a game that's framed by an oracle of the contents of the bookcases/evidence lockers/etc of a detective/detective agency/special bureau/etc. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm imagining beginning at the crossing grounds between &lt;a href="http://www.warehouse23.com/"&gt;Warehouse 23&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.mongoosepublishing.com/home/detail.php?qsID=1607&amp;amp;qsSeries=43"&gt;The Extraordinary Adventures of Baron Munchausen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Munchausen, a player is challenged by an opening request for a story, like "Dear Baron, do tell us about the time that you successfully invaded the palace of the Grand Turk armed only with a house cat," and then proceeds to say so, interrupted only by those players who offer him points to complicate his story further.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warehouse 23 was the name Steve Jackson games gave to that warehouse at the end of &lt;i&gt;Raiders&lt;/i&gt;, or to one very much like it, filled with every bit of stuff that the conspiracy thinks you can't handle.&amp;nbsp; It had it's own &lt;a href="http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/warehouse23/"&gt;supplement for GURPS&lt;/a&gt;, but I first encountered it as &lt;a href="http://www.warehouse23.com/basement/box/"&gt;an online oracle of the contents of random crates&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it could be as easy as replacing the Baron with some equally eclectic but curiosity-collecting personage and making every challenge "Excuse me, but what the hell is THIS?!"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Baron Munchausen sounds (I confess to not having played it, though I'd very much like to) as if it only has a single emotional note: wit, high spirits, jesting apparent-seriousness, old-world politeness and charm.&amp;nbsp; I feel like I'd most like something that can run a gamut of moods, but takes a much more somber tone as a baseline. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And very few of Warehouse 23's contents, even the scary ones, can be seen as serious, and most of them are downright ridiculous.&amp;nbsp; One box is described as containing every bag lunch the opening character has ever lost, most marked "Results: Negative," except for the most recent one, which seems to have been more promising.&amp;nbsp; This is hardly the kind of elliptical-but-suggestive and inert-but-threatening object I mean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I'd need the framing device to be more thoughtful than raucous...perhaps the Collector has always spent all his energy and put all adventures behind him.&amp;nbsp; Perhaps they are dead at the start of the game.&amp;nbsp; Are we intruding on them in some way?&amp;nbsp; Did we not know them, or at least, not know this part of their life? &amp;nbsp;I need to spend some time at farmhouse auctions...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then it's just a matter of making a few deliciously-themed lists of fifty-two super-cool Curiosities!&amp;nbsp; Yeah, you're gonna have to give me some time for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And! &amp;nbsp;I can imagine doing something like a tarot spread with the cards each person draws.&amp;nbsp; Each card would be placed in a position that represented a particular phase in the collector's life, like Passions of Youth or Settling Down, or maybe a particular kind of event, like the first (or last) meeting with a life-long love (or enmity).&amp;nbsp; You continue until the spaces of the spread are all full, in which case you've handled and told the Collector's life along with his gewgaws.</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2009/02/cabinet-of-curiosities.html#comment-form' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/8452345174821179105'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/8452345174821179105'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2009/02/cabinet-of-curiosities.html' title='Cabinet of Curiosities'/><author><name>Nick Novitski</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08863651199447917923</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31707300.post-8292618966820203994</id><published>2009-10-06T20:35:00.001-04:00</published><updated>2009-10-19T16:38:53.763-04:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Why I Am Excited About the Next Edition of WFRP</title><content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://draft.blogger.com/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span id="goog_1255445810621"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id="goog_1255445810622"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The short answer is because most people who have played "Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay" in previous incarnations and talk about it online seem to be really upset about it, to judge from the comment threads on the game's "&lt;a href="http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?etyn=1&amp;amp;ecan=62&amp;amp;epn=0"&gt;Edge Minisite&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The less short answer: it's being made by &lt;a href="http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/"&gt;Fantasy Flight Games&lt;/a&gt;, designers of excellent board games (especially ones that blur the boundaries with fiction games), and they are applying those design sensibilities to the creaking edifice of &lt;a href="http://www.games-workshop.com/"&gt;Games Workshop&lt;/a&gt;'s RPG sideshow, demanding that the accumulated cruft of traditional fiction game systems justify themselves, creating new and useful physical components, and best of all, playtesting the shit out of it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To these old eyes, it is looking white hot. &amp;nbsp;If it isn't the Third Path between Indie and (for current lack of a better term) "The Man" games, then at least it can show what happens when excellent and inclusive design is used to sell big boxes of special dice and glossy paper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I can say more. &amp;nbsp;What follows is the blow-by-blow summary of the information released so far, with a focus on the bits that excite me. &amp;nbsp;And as a special double-bonus, I'll include the occasional fanboy entitlement-spasm from the comment thread.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, it all started with the video of a seminar Jay Little held at this past Gencon. &amp;nbsp;I think&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://githyankidiaspora.wordpress.com/"&gt;Judd&lt;/a&gt; linked to it. &amp;nbsp;I found it quite arresting and fascinating stuff, full of astonishing tidbits. &amp;nbsp;Most of what he discusses gets expanded upon in later posts (that is, further down this very page). &amp;nbsp;But here's a significant point: the &lt;a href="http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=752"&gt;core boxed set&lt;/a&gt; comes with a pack of custom dice, four big full-color books, and passels of cards and sheets. &amp;nbsp;The suggested retail price is $100.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is a big initial investment, and a step very out of line with the typical tiered sales method of rpgs: you hear about a cool game, and to signal interest, you purchase a book, which you then show to your friends, in the hopes that they'll want to signal interest also. &amp;nbsp;Actually playing just increases the chances that you'll tell other people about it, who might also buy, and increases the chances that you'll buy later expansions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set is meant to contain everything any group of four players - and some groups of five or six - need for play: Buy it, and you already have everything you need to play the game with any three people you convince to try it. &amp;nbsp;Put another way: Think of it as buying a very different kind of board game (that is, one with no board or winners or losers and all that other page one Intro to Roleplaying crap).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How many books would similarly sized groups need to play D&amp;amp;D 4th? &amp;nbsp;A conservative estimate would be two: the Players Handbook and the Dungeon Master's Guide. &amp;nbsp;But you'll probably want at least one extra PHB, to clear the bottleneck when two different people have questions, and an adventure would be nice, and maybe a book of monsters, and if you're interested in a fancy type of character or a different setting...Spending $100 on a game for four is actually something that's done a surprising amount. &amp;nbsp;It's just all the active ingredients finally collected in a single pill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Commenter MVP: Sunatet&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;"In the old REAL warhammer I can take 2 dice, ONE book (love the 2-nd edition hard cover), some of my own printed and disposable handouts, paper and pencil, go out in the woods, to the sea, or whenever I like in the day, or night, and play with my players without worries that my beautifull handouts/skill cards/whatever will be destroyed in the process, without worrying that I loose my unique precious dice (I can buy d10 in EVERY game shop). THAT is where Warhammer spirit IS. THAT is what REAL Warhammer IS. Not this shitty tabletop game, with it's fragile cards, that requires lots of table space (basing on those movies)."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next they posted an&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=756"&gt;FAQ&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;Notable entries:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The new edition was designed to provide new roleplayers "an accessible,&amp;nbsp;customisable and engaging roleplaying system," and veterans "some new and interesting options&amp;nbsp;to add to their roleplaying experience."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"More than a dozen different core mechanics for task resolution&amp;nbsp;were designed, evaluated, and tested over the course of the development&amp;nbsp;of the new edition of Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay, including&amp;nbsp;some more traditional task resolution models." After settling on dice pools as offering the right feel, "a&amp;nbsp;number of different dice pool models were developed&amp;nbsp;and tested, until we settled on the the system that combined the&amp;nbsp;engaging play experience we wanted with the mechanical results&amp;nbsp;that could drive the system’s engine."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Commenter MVP: Peacekeeper_b&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;"You are pretty funny. You are all so protective and defensive over a system you havent even played yet, and we are all sad and grumpy cause we are losing a game we have played and paid for. Yes we can still play with the old rules, but you know what, that isnt the point."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"&gt;"You know what, nevermind. Obviously people who are not happy with a new edition are not suppose to post on this site anymore."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Next comes &lt;a href="http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=764"&gt;a broad overview of the process of character creation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 1: Choose a race...but we've already gone astray. &amp;nbsp;Properly speaking, characters in this system have an &lt;i&gt;ethnicity&lt;/i&gt;, a culture which also has an attendant species. &amp;nbsp;Thus, we have Elves Who Live In The Woods, Elves Who Live In Their Cities, Humans Who Live in Reikland (a province of "The Empire," which is more benign than it sounds) and Dwarves Who Live in Karak Azgaraz (a recently founded stronghold). &amp;nbsp;These are the four types of folks most frequently found running around Reikland, wherein the base set is...set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's not the first time, but I'm still happy see another game go the &lt;i&gt;Elder Scrolls&lt;/i&gt; route, saying "you're from somewhere, and you were shaped by the majority culture of that place." &amp;nbsp;Admittedly, there are only four choices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 2: Draw three cards from the deck of careers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Commenter MVP: captainflakk&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;"No Halflings???!!!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Commenter MVP: the_crom&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: #a9adb8; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow. How quickly the sheeple fall into line. What happened to everybody who was complaining about this game? Did they just stop bothering to check in to see what's going on?&lt;br /&gt;At the risk of being called elitist, I'm going to reiterate. This is NOT a roleplaying game. This is a board game that is trying to emulate a roleplaying game. A roleplaying game is about imagination, its about a world built entirely in the head of the players. The rules are there to provide a framework to resolve actions. They are not there to force players to work together, to act a certain way, or even to build a story. The players do that. At its finest, an RPG doesn't even need rules. Some of the best adventures I've ever played in, the dice were never rolled. Could you do that with this game? The tension meter is the game's mechanics interfering with the player's dynamics. Same with the crazy dice. I'm disgusted at this game. It's a dishonor to the fine tradition of Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay.&lt;br /&gt;From what I hear, Fantasy Flight Games already tried to release this product under a different name and it was a horrible flop. So now that the have the Warhammer Fantasy license, they're just using the license at the expense of the current players. (Who liked the game, by the way.) Is there any truth to that statement, or is that just a nasty rumor?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, and most recently, we have a post on &lt;a href="http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=850"&gt;Scene Structure and Budgeting&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;The most interesting point I take from it is that after every delineated "act" in the adventure, there will be something called the "rally step," which seems to have a purpose like the refresh scenes of Solar System.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;The rally step is when characters and players alike can catch their breath. In-game, it is a chance for characters to reorient, rearm, and refocus – the PCs have a brief respite, just enough time to bind a wound, draw a sword, notch an arrow, and prepare for what comes next. In out-of-character terms it is the pause for bathroom breaks, drink refills, nagging rules questions, and off-topic asides.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In general, the emphasis on structure leads to . &amp;nbsp;Though it does make it sound slightly less character-driven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's talk about &lt;a href="http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=859"&gt;how to attack in combat&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;commenter MVP: Akherion&lt;br /&gt;Is there a card for the most important thing called: FREEDOM OF ACTION ?????</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/8292618966820203994'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/8292618966820203994'/><author><name>Nick Novitski</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08863651199447917923</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31707300.post-5147681519640089030</id><published>2009-10-06T20:28:00.000-04:00</published><updated>2009-10-06T20:28:13.874-04:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='reading'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='neologism'/><title type='text'>All Famous People Know One Another</title><content type='html'>Cory Doctorow is podcast-serializing a new short-story, &lt;a href="http://craphound.com/?p=2337"&gt;Epoch&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;It's about how boring creating human-level AI would be. &amp;nbsp;Exciting!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you're done listening, as a special bonus, scroll down the comments to see Bruce Campbell give Cory some heartfelt and well-meant criticism. &amp;nbsp;Seriously.</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2009/10/all-famous-people-know-one-another.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/5147681519640089030'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/5147681519640089030'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2009/10/all-famous-people-know-one-another.html' title='All Famous People Know One Another'/><author><name>Nick Novitski</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08863651199447917923</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31707300.post-2903667928940371096</id><published>2009-10-06T18:00:00.002-04:00</published><updated>2009-10-09T09:31:27.967-04:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='journalism'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='gaming'/><title type='text'>Developing Trends in "User-Generated"</title><content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/RPSfull/~3/e4t4KWl0h-Y/"&gt;From RPS&lt;/a&gt;: Valve (&lt;i&gt;Half-Life, Half-life 2, Team Fortress 2, Portal, Left 4 Dead, Left 4 Dead 2)&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;has hired the reclusive IceFrog, who's been developing &lt;i&gt;Defense of the Ancients: Allstars&lt;/i&gt; (a &lt;i&gt;Warcraft 3&lt;/i&gt; mod that has been far more popular than &lt;i&gt;Warcraft 3&lt;/i&gt; for several years now, that pits two teams of any five of ninety-five (!) unique heroes in a rpg/strategy beatdown) since version 6.01.  &lt;a href="http://www.playdota.com/forums/blogs/icefrog/264/great-news-dota-fans/"&gt;His official word&lt;/a&gt; on the subject sounds appropriately excited and NDA-d, revealing he's been given &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;his own dev team&lt;/span&gt;, and that this is great news for DotA fans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This comes hot on, if not the &lt;b&gt;heels&lt;/b&gt;, then the &lt;b&gt;trail&lt;/b&gt; of Blizzcon, when Blizzard announced Starcraft 2's being designed to gleefully co-opt the creative impulses of Blizzard fans.  You'll doubtless remember &lt;a href="http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2009/09/blizzcon-2009-part-5-starcraft-app.html"&gt;my reaction to that news&lt;/a&gt;, which I characterized as being a direct response to the success of &lt;i&gt;DotA: Allstars&lt;/i&gt;, and Valve's distribution/community software, Steam.  To say nothing of Valve's propensity to cherry-pick the best of the amateur game developer world, now re-demonstrated. &amp;nbsp;This all leaves&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I expect an arms race; good, extensible games gather a community of players interested in extending the game, and the larger the pool of&amp;nbsp;practitioners&amp;nbsp;gets, the better the top 1% of them get.  And the more companies buy into that strategy, the more competetive and flexible they'll become in their offers, until they've thinned themselves into branded portals, and the possibility space is seeded with a thousand thousand budding developers, inventing three genres a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I try to distrust axioms, but how strong the siren song calls from "more games is always better!" &amp;nbsp;The only dark cloud is that Steam and similar distribution platforms will give the established players a big advantage. &amp;nbsp;Steve Feak, the creator of Allstars, bravely founded &lt;a href="http://www.riotgames.com/"&gt;Riot Games&lt;/a&gt;, due to release the openly-DotA-inspired &lt;i&gt;League of Legends: Clash of the Fates&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="color: #1d1d1d; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;"&gt;&lt;span style="color: black; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Real Soon Now, but funding, developing, promoting, selling, distributing and supporting your own game is a steeplechase many developers won't bother trying to run. &amp;nbsp;And even if they were able to, on the internet as in physical retail, buying something from an self-owned shop demands more of the customer than the one-stop big-box store. &amp;nbsp;I mean, there's mp3s till hell won't hold them all around the internet, but rather than search for and become familiar with the stockrooms and storefronts of a dozen different sites, gaining a greater selection, and perhaps even saving some web-dollars, most people are satisfied to learn the iTunes interface &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;once&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2009/10/developing-trends-in-user-generated.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/2903667928940371096'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/2903667928940371096'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2009/10/developing-trends-in-user-generated.html' title='Developing Trends in &quot;User-Generated&quot;'/><author><name>Nick Novitski</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08863651199447917923</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31707300.post-6364411618978925190</id><published>2009-10-06T10:00:00.001-04:00</published><updated>2009-10-06T10:00:02.964-04:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='journalism'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='religion'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='history'/><title type='text'>Modernity’s Fraternity</title><content type='html'>From KtB's Sam Biagetti, &lt;a href="http://killingthebuddha.com/mag/exegesis/modernity%e2%80%99s-fraternity/"&gt;an unreview of Dan Brown's Masonic potboiler&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To paraphrase Gaiman, there's always been and always will be an Atlantis.  Though that's not right: Atlantis was at its most popular this past century.  Before that, people spoke of the underground river, or the chymical wedding, or if they were Masons, of the lost Word of the Temple.   The common motif is ancient wisdom of sacred immensity, hidden beneath the weight of catastrophe, but waiting in the underlying-places, visible in hints and glances that only make partial sense out of the world, until the stars are right, our practices of arduous purity grant O-9 level revelations, and the eschaton gets immanetized right the fuck out.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Conspiracy, religion, schizophrenia, despair: pick one.  The rabbit-hole of "but it all must mean something" has swallowed many an Alice.   At least Mr. Brown seems to avoid the trap which caught the poor authors of &lt;i&gt;Holy Blood, Holy Grail&lt;/i&gt;, who openly entreat the secret masters of the world to come out behind that curtain because we &lt;i&gt;know&lt;/i&gt; you're there and won't you tell us how clever we are!  There's a venerable tradition of such publications, philosophy/history/magical practice as the &lt;i&gt;cri de coeur&lt;/i&gt; of the lost child in the supermarket, or perhaps the one who knows their &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;real&lt;/span&gt; parents are secret agents and/or circus acrobats.  One would think they read &lt;i&gt;HBHG&lt;/i&gt; without having also read &lt;i&gt;Foucault's Pendulum.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Personally, Masonicism seems far too boring as far as secret religions go.   If they aren't running drug-fueled possession-dances or ritually debasing themselves before Baphomet, there just isn't a draw for me.  If I wanted a social club, I'd claim to be Christian, and if I wanted a calm voyage of self-actualization, I'd claim to be Buddhist.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This isn't to knock those who are looking for such things; as Cory Doctorow put it, lots of people play it safe, and it doesn't make them assholes, even when it makes them ineffectual and useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Nick&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2009/10/modernitys-fraternity.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/6364411618978925190'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/6364411618978925190'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2009/10/modernitys-fraternity.html' title='Modernity’s Fraternity'/><author><name>Nick Novitski</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08863651199447917923</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31707300.post-4803789671928348277</id><published>2009-10-05T10:10:00.000-04:00</published><updated>2009-10-05T10:10:58.640-04:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='then I had some toast'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='music'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='gaming'/><title type='text'>Intermission, with Orff</title><content type='html'>For nearly half my life, I've wondered what song is being sung in the intro movie to the original &lt;i&gt;Quake&lt;/i&gt; mod &lt;i&gt;Team Fortress&lt;/i&gt;.  Specifically, I've wondered since said movie was released as part of version 2.0 of said mod, released 22 December 1996. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;object height="344" width="425"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/8FVJ__rBFxk&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/8FVJ__rBFxk&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always found it delightfully punchy and suggestive, liable to spark the imagination.  It's stuck with me, even over a decade after I had last played the game.  And many times over the years, I've tried to find out just what the hell it is. &amp;nbsp;I've pored over the manuals and readmes, scoured the internet, sent emails to the developers, even hummed it to music buffs. &amp;nbsp;Failure! &amp;nbsp;Ignominy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, thanks to a commenter in the above youtube video, THE SEARCH HAS ENDED. &amp;nbsp; I humbly present: from Carl Orff's Carmina Burana, &lt;a href="http://www.archive.org/details/EcceGratum"&gt;Ecce Gratum&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lyrics are all about spring and the growing of green things. &amp;nbsp;The repetition of the theme is suggestive in it's own way. &amp;nbsp;It makes me think of the triple-repetitions of fairy tales, or maybe a generational cycle of blood-streaked revenge amongst the pealing

href="http://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fimago.hitherby.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2009%2F09%2Fwtf.pdf"&gt;Wisher, Theurgist, Fatalist&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe you haven't heard of it! &amp;nbsp;It was released for free without warning earlier this week, which may make this a personal best turnaround time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were six of us playing in the end, though only three of us had read most of the document. &amp;nbsp;The others were more or less willing to play on the strength of the author; Jenna Moran (until more recently published under the name Rebecca Borgstrom) is a name to conjure players with. &amp;nbsp;She mostly-wrote &lt;i&gt;Nobilis&lt;/i&gt;, probably the most beautiful fiction game like, ever. &amp;nbsp;She mostly-wrote &lt;i&gt;Weapons of the Gods&lt;/i&gt;, probably the best kung-fu fiction game like, ever. &amp;nbsp;Her names have certainly sold me on more game products, sight unseen, than any other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The short review is that we (male, in our 20s, enjoyers of playing, thinking and discussing games) had a great deal of fun, and all of us would be interested in playing it again. &amp;nbsp;Several of us might, because there was at least one person who wanted to play but was busy doing something else. &amp;nbsp;I look forward to any further opportunities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The game rewards reading, and I recommend checking it out. &amp;nbsp;But here's a summary of my impressions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The text is 100 pages. &amp;nbsp;They aren't numbered, or generally laid out for printing. &amp;nbsp;If they were, they would probably be physically separated into a series of four books, one named "Everyone read" and the others each focused on one of the three types of characters - on which more later - so that more people could consult it simultaneously. &amp;nbsp;And consult you shall!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The style is quite self-aware and at times tongue in cheek. &amp;nbsp;There are no fewer than three separate flowchart-systems. &amp;nbsp;One of them is a system on the different ways that one finds out that one is/has been playing the game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;The shadow node represents the willful ego that does not want to play WTF.&lt;br /&gt;"It's unplayable!" you cry.&lt;br /&gt;"She's gone off the deep end this time!"&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Immediately following this is an extended discussion of exactly how players communicate with one another, including classifications for all the types of speech used when playing a game ("Statements Regarding the World," "Statements as Made by Your Character," "Statements as Made by Other Characters," etc). &amp;nbsp;Complete with examples!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All this entertains, but was also a bit edifying: the barriers between playing-something and not-playing-something are surprisingly porous. &amp;nbsp;Talking things out is something that people seem to forget how to do when discussing game systems! &amp;nbsp;Also, it taught me that WTF is a game where you see-saw rapidly between being light-hearted and being serious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also a game about Wishers, Theurgists, and Fatalists, the three sorts of folks needed to save the world from its contingent ontological state. &amp;nbsp;The characters are destined to join and quest for the Jewel of All Desiring, with which a Wisher (made worthy by Theurgist's testing, and empowered by a Fatalist's sacrifice) can make the world &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;be&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;always have been&lt;/span&gt; real. &amp;nbsp;The Jewel of All Desiring lets the Wisher create exactly the world they wish, which means, by definition, that everything that is narrated into the story is something that the Wisher wants or will want to be so. &amp;nbsp;Which can be strange, because all the other players have a say in what is and is not a part of the world. &amp;nbsp;If they are also the Weaver, then they are encouraged to make very bad things part of the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's talk more about these roles. &amp;nbsp;Fatalists are savants, people who know everything about how the world is. &amp;nbsp;They favor&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Knowledge&lt;/b&gt;, a stat that can be rolled in order to establish who gets to say what things are currently the case (including the past and destined events, and the rules of the game). &amp;nbsp;Theurgists are Gandalfs, people who know the possibilities for change hidden to most. &amp;nbsp;They favor &lt;b&gt;Insight&lt;/b&gt;, a stat that can be rolled in order to change things (including the rules of the game). &amp;nbsp;Wishers are charismatic unifiers of apparently opposing moral positions. &amp;nbsp;They favor &lt;b&gt;Harmony&lt;/b&gt;, a stat that can be rolled to say what's morally right and wrong, bring people together, and establish what things mean (including what position the text of the game supports, and what on earth the Wisher was thinking when he wished for whatever just happened).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the roles split the powers of the traditional GM between them, but one player is also the Weaver, who has the responsibilities of the traditional GM, providing arbitrary and unending antagonism. &amp;nbsp;The Weaver is whoever says that they are, except that it can change. &amp;nbsp;In our game (yours might be different), someone decided that they could roll Knowledge to determine that I had been lying the whole time and someone else had been the Weaver the whole time. &amp;nbsp;The rules do provide for a more standard change of Weaver status: the current Weaver can accuse a Theurgist of being corrupted by the Shadow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Shadow is corruption, paradox, a hungering evil. &amp;nbsp;In the games own words: "The Shadow &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a moral implication, but does not &lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt; one." &amp;nbsp;That is, whenever things are evil, they are connected to the Shadow, but the existence of the Shadow doesn't necessitate you to do anything that you wouldn't otherwise. &amp;nbsp;All of the characters have a risk of falling to that corruption. &amp;nbsp;Anyone rolling Knowledge has to tell what they know to be the truth; they can decide that they are lying, in which case they have been corrupted and now can say self-contradictory things, making the world mutable and scary. &amp;nbsp;Anyone rolling Insight has to change things to the way they think they &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;should&lt;/span&gt; be; the Weaver can claim that this is not so, which starts a roll-off. &amp;nbsp;If the Weaver wins, then the Insight-eer can now destroy things with their magics and live in a moral vacuum. &amp;nbsp;Essentially, they become Saruman. &amp;nbsp;If the Insight-roller wins, then they are now the Weaver. &amp;nbsp;Surprise! &amp;nbsp;This bit shocked the hell out of me: game roles that shift based on the results of conflict! &amp;nbsp;Imagine if in&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Polaris&lt;/i&gt;, the Moons could become the Heart by helping the Mistaken get the current Heart to...I don't know, admit that they had made a mistake!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone rolling Harmony has to actually unify opposites; any player can claim that the proposed harmony is deceptive. &amp;nbsp;The players all pick sides. &amp;nbsp;If the accuser wins, then the Harmonizer can now roll to argue for virtues they don't actually support (and that the shadow does). &amp;nbsp;Also, if they wish on the Jewel of All Desiring, the players lose the game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the Harmony-roller wins, then the accuser is no longer playing the game. &amp;nbsp;That is, when someone denies the true harmony of the group, they have thrown up a barrier between them and the rest of the group which has no place in this sort of game. &amp;nbsp;Some found this controversial. &amp;nbsp;Jason told me, "You are talking about high-trust designs, whereas I prefer low-trust designs." &amp;nbsp;I wanted to say, "I trust you!" &amp;nbsp;But my tongue was tied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So there are rules for arguing (or rather, for limiting the amount of arguing you do) over what the rules are. &amp;nbsp;And then there are even conscious omissions from the text in order to spark the need for consensus. &amp;nbsp;The game tells you that you can make "Confidence rolls," and you can, but precisely what those are is quite up to you. &amp;nbsp;The game tells you that in some games, players author their own kickers, whereas in others, they receive a call to action from the Weaver, but which sort of game this is is up to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think its fair to say that, if we love anything, its that kind of discussion. &amp;nbsp;So we did fight our way through phantasmagorical fantasy with gusto, but the excited discussion of what is and should be and what it all meant spilled out onto the streets and lasted until the first wee hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That reminds me, I believe that the most most-discussed aspect of the system turned out to be the Gifts. &amp;nbsp;Their use and utility seemed obvious to me, but this may have been from my perspective as having read the entire text, and having been the Weaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A gift is like an aspect, except it is best to write them as a sentence about your character. &amp;nbsp;For example, my character's gifts were "Trusting" ("I trust easily" might have been better) and "I'm better with a sword than &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;anyone&lt;/span&gt;!" &amp;nbsp;Gifts also have three properties - Truth, Mechanical Support, and Valence - which can each have one of three values - normal, strong or weak. &amp;nbsp;Characters can have 0 to 5 gifts. &amp;nbsp;They don't cost anything: you just choose how many you have. &amp;nbsp;For that reason alone, you might think that their impact will be vague and innumerate. &amp;nbsp;How clever of you! &amp;nbsp;Personally, I found almost every other player taking the maximum number, assuming they were universally good things (actually, all of them except for one start of being disadvantageous).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Truth of a gift is what it sounds like. &amp;nbsp;A weakly true thing might be something that the character says, or even believes, but it seems unlikely, and easy to doubt, and anyone could introduce contravening testimony. &amp;nbsp;A strongly true gift is axiomatic to the very fabric of the universe. &amp;nbsp;Mountains may turn out to be illusions, but 1 equals 1 and my character is trusting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;The Mechanical Support of a gift is how good it is at solving problems. &amp;nbsp;Weak mechanical support would means that whenever my character got into a sword duel, if anyone cared, they could claim that I lose. &amp;nbsp;In fact, I'd be expected to. &amp;nbsp;Perhaps I might say I had won duels in the past, but when it counts, I'm the plaything of fate. &amp;nbsp;Strong Mechanical Support means that, if I can ever construe a situation as solvable by swordsmanship, as soon as that, it is solved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Valence means whether, when you use your gift, good or bad things result. &amp;nbsp;Weak valence might mean that my sword-skill will not win any wars, will not make me rich or famed, will likely make me a pariah or criminal as soon as someone could think of a good way it could happen. &amp;nbsp;Strong valence means that my display of excellent swordsmanship is seen by the king and he bestows a knighthood on me, or even that my brave, loosing fight against impossible odds inspires the townsfolk to take up arms and drive the barbarians from their town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of these three, the use of Truth confused most people, and they found the distinction between Mechanical Support and Valence the least clear. &amp;nbsp;As for me, I think this system is fantastic and I want it in my other loose narrative games. &amp;nbsp;Just think: you can customize the way in which your aspects are problematic, and the way in which they help, and then they get out of the way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, I very much recommend it. &amp;nbsp;We may have been on the bleeding edge of group size: try it with three or four. &amp;nbsp;Also, we might have been too eager to roll dice and then say what we want to happen/to be the case/things to mean. &amp;nbsp;If I played again, I would encourage everyone to turn and ask the people playing the appropriate roles first, and then negotiate and seek consensus if you have a different idea, and then roll dice if you have irreconcilable views. &amp;nbsp;Of course, that's what the game says to do, but it said it somewhere else than the big obvious "heres how you roll dice" section, so we couldn't find it. &amp;nbsp;So that's also play advice: bind the books as actual separate books, because when you roll the stats is explained on their very first pages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It certainly is nice to have Miss Moran rejoin us after her long silence! &amp;nbsp;And she brought wonderful gifts! &amp;nbsp;This was actually only one of a series of products serially dumped on us from&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://imago.hitherby.com/"&gt;her blog&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;this week. &amp;nbsp;There was also an incomplete rpg called &lt;a href="http://imago.hitherby.com/?p=3094"&gt;Dreaming Waters&lt;/a&gt;, an alternate psychadelic kung-fu hero setting for &lt;i&gt;Nobilis&lt;/i&gt; called &lt;a href="http://imago.hitherby.com/?p=3090"&gt;A Soul of Your Own&lt;/a&gt;, the second free supplement for &lt;i&gt;Nobilis&lt;/i&gt; named &lt;a href="http://imago.hitherby.com/?p=3085"&gt;Creatures Clothed in Strangeness&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;nbsp;a nameless &lt;a href="http://imago.hitherby.com/?p=3078"&gt;system-independent system for corruption- and madness-driven scientific or social projects&lt;/a&gt; (which I think could be made into a game itself), and even a teensy supplement for WTF, Thus Languidly Dreamt Raif (also acronymmitable). &amp;nbsp;An&amp;nbsp;embarrassment&amp;nbsp;of riches I will do my best to deserve through happy use.&lt;br

type='text'>Science Flunk You</title><content type='html'>A few months ago, a friend sent me this article:&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-family: arial;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.salon.com/env/feature/2009/07/13/science_illiteracy/?source=newsletter" style="color: #406480; text-decoration: none;" target="_blank"&gt;Why America is flunking Science (Salon.com)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;He also commented:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;Honestly, I can't remember seeing a scientist depicted in a positive light in entertainment at all (where the character was an authentic scientist, and not just in name).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;I think the bit of&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;Anathem&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;that was commentary on this was one of my favorite parts. &amp;nbsp;The narrator and his friends, cloistered scientist/philosophers, are trained in an iconography of the ways people have tended to misunderstand and misrepresent them over the millenia. &amp;nbsp;Recurrent themes like "binder of powers best not meddled with," "ambitious and crazed with power," "unemotional and sterile," (and/or "juvenile and sexually frustrated,") "resentful and untrustworthy," "absent-minded and obsessed with the unimportant," but with evocative names and drawings. &amp;nbsp;The Anti-Intellectual Tarot.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few days ago, Aaron Reed published a comic called &lt;a href="http://dresdencodak.com/2009/09/22/caveman-science-fiction/"&gt;Caveman Science Fiction&lt;/a&gt;, on much of the same subject.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That prompted me to remember a short story by Umberto Eco, called The Thing (unrelated to either movie of that name). &amp;nbsp;It's collected in the book &lt;i&gt;Misreadings&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;and...hey, look! &amp;nbsp;It's available in the Google Books free preview! &amp;nbsp;Have a read, it's very short (but don't miss the italicized bit at the end, which makes the real last page).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="500" scrolling="no" src="http://books.google.com/books?id=g8L6CKIHFs0C&amp;amp;lpg=PP1&amp;amp;ots=-kNTVwbG9o&amp;amp;dq=umberto%20eco%20misreadings&amp;amp;pg=PA62&amp;amp;output=embed" style="border: 0px;" width="500"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recall having a different understanding of the story when I first read it (I might have been 12) than I do now. &amp;nbsp;Then, I saw it as commentary on mankind's fallen state, a look at what&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;V for Vendetta &lt;/i&gt;calls&amp;nbsp;"some monstrous flaw in all of us," that turns every tool for betterment into a tool for oppression. &amp;nbsp;But re-reading it today, I suddenly remembered the context of the book, which includes a publishing editor's criticisms and suggestions for the Christian bible, a condescending anthropological study of a region in Italy, and a transcript of the live broadcast of Columbus' landing, complete with excited talking heads commentating on the rapine. &amp;nbsp;So I can only interpret The Thing as being, like the others, commentary on a particular form of writing, applied to an unusual subject, with ironic results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For what reason I don't know,&amp;nbsp;we've built a culture-tradition over the last few decades (especially in movies) of making&amp;nbsp;caricatures of geeks, despite huge swathes of people with money identifying with them. &amp;nbsp;It's become so ingrained that it's a joke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;Since they don't have real existence, I'm not precisely sure, when it comes to characters, what counts as being a scientist, or how to distinguish them from engineers, or rationalists. &amp;nbsp;I think that I've read books with scientists as the heroes (certainly Anathem counts, as well as several others by Stephenson), and I've even read ones where the action of the story was people doing science (Michael Creighton was good at this, with&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;Andromeda Strain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;Sphere,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;and of course, huge swathes of&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;Jurassic Park&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;). &amp;nbsp;As for film, the geekiest-in-a-normal-way movie I've seen in years was &lt;i&gt;Primer&lt;/i&gt;, which is what you get if you took a commercially successful film and "reversed its polarity." &amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;And don't say it doesn't matter. &amp;nbsp;Social recognition is a proven factor in the popularity of different careers, and popularity is a proven factor in broad and deep advances in a field. &amp;nbsp;But we're on the other side of the coin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;What painted us into this corner? &amp;nbsp;We know it's&amp;nbsp;not always this way: the 40s and 50s were awash with science-heroes, sending us to space, protecting us from the reds and the browns, uncovering the mysteries of what-went-on-before. &amp;nbsp;The medieval Caliphate tended not to burn people who determined the circumference of the world and the motions of the heavens. &amp;nbsp;Europe in the 18th and 19th centuries was science-crazy, at least compared to today. &amp;nbsp;Ambitions for explaining things without (apparent) recourse to (traditional) superstitions was so in vogue, that it caused Mary Shelly to imagine a new kind of Prometheus, driven to do a thing that had never been done, to completely ignore the very concept of "forbidden knowledge."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;But the pendulum swings the other way too. &amp;nbsp;The phrase "Dark Ages" has been criticized as uninformative, cruel and self-centered ever since Petrarch complained that for six-hundred years, no one had been writing any new literature in Latin. &amp;nbsp;But people persist in using it for the same reason he coined it: it seems to entirely lack development of a thing they believe essential, or at least important, or at least greatly to be desired. &amp;nbsp;And that's why I use it: because for hundreds of years, the people whose job it was to think preferred to illuminate manuscripts, eat and sing. &amp;nbsp;And maybe we're back in that groove, and have been since at least when Umberto Eco (famed medievalist) published &lt;i&gt;Travels in Hyperreality&lt;/i&gt;, the first chapter of which is about America and the second chapter of which is about the New Middle Ages...or it could almost as easily be the other way around.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What digs that groove, swings that pendulum, drives that curve? &amp;nbsp;Are there times when new ideas are more rewarded? &amp;nbsp;Maybe it's just a matter of prosperity and safety; that would explain the Victorian and post-WW2 boom. &amp;nbsp;Which would bode very ill indeed for our future, looking relatively un-safe and un-prosperous, if it weren't for technology's proven tendency to disproportionately empower individuals and small groups. &amp;nbsp;I guess it depends on how much optimism you can muster, or how much you value scientific progress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended reading, beyond works already mentioned:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.shigabooks.com/shigabooks/csfolder/fleep.html"&gt;Fleep&lt;/a&gt;, a brief (44 pages of six panels each) meditation on the nature of Rational Heroism.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.tor.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=blog&amp;amp;id=%2038507"&gt;Makers&lt;/a&gt;, Cory Doctorow's next novel, being released serially on Tor before physical publication, attempting to point a path to hope through America's trash-strewn future. &amp;nbsp;Think of it as a cross between &lt;i&gt;Snow Crash&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;and a Michael Moore film (but please don't let that scare you off).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:

type='text'>Idea: Finishing School</title><content type='html'>(Interesting that I first thought of the blog as the place to put this. &amp;nbsp;Here's an idea for a future post: blogs are the modern era's answer to the Commonplace Book...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A small number of people sign up for cryogenics nowadays, but as more do, the numbers of the "frozen" will increase. &amp;nbsp;Those with families will doubtless sign up their spouses, children, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wait, ignore that bit for a second. &amp;nbsp;Focus on the Cryogenics&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thought of waking up in the future is hardly a new idea; it's significantly older than science fiction. &amp;nbsp;But the idea of how different the future will be has changed quite a lot. &amp;nbsp;Rip Van Winkle woke up to find new people living in his town, or the war being over or a new one started, but the town was still there. &amp;nbsp;The unnamed protagonist of &lt;i&gt;The Time Machine&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;finds mankind differentiated and specialized across separated mutualist populations, and then witnesses the eventual dying of the earth. &amp;nbsp;Asimov wrote a short story (title forgotten, since who can keep track of them all?) where an anomaly engulfs a modern man, sending him into an Asimovian galaxy-spanning future, where he is pored over by amazed scientists ("He can grow hair on his face! &amp;nbsp;And his appendix is nearly two inches long!"). &amp;nbsp;Warren Ellis wrote &lt;i&gt;Transmetropolitan&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;with the &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;specific intent&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;of freaking you out, and then showed us that when &amp;nbsp;we present-day folk walked out the halfway home for the reconsituted to our first look at his neither-utopia-nor-dystopia City, we were sent into a near-catatonia that might not abate except with death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's only one step behind the current prevailing democratic transhumanist theory, which is that you wake up and everything's normal at first, due to a need for a period of gradual adjustment, and you can't even be sure that you &lt;b&gt;physically exist&lt;/b&gt; in the same way you're used to using those words.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(The Libertarian Transhumanists think that the future people will feel no obligation to resurrect and upgrade simple neanderthals like you, at which point you might reasonably ask, "Then what's the point of being a Libertarian Transhumanist?" &amp;nbsp;To which I can give no answer.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I mean is, in the future, it might be more convenient for everyone to be simulated, and if the world is significantly altered, it might be far more convenient for all us dead frozen folks to be scanned and simulated, rather than given a body, etc. &amp;nbsp;And then we might ask things of our keepers like "but is this &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;me?", we might betray our ignorance by the standards of the time; we will have equated our notional body with identity, the same way a hunter-gatherer could equate notional image with identity, and shun the cameras which can capture his soul.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, assuming we're brought back for more than just being toyed with by godlike-to-us posthuman intelligences...no, wait. &amp;nbsp;Actually, don't assume that. &amp;nbsp;Let me try again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So we show up in this slightly weird place. &amp;nbsp;I mean, it looks a lot like a simple sanatorium, but after all,&amp;nbsp;here you are, alive, cancer-free, possibly in a younger body. &amp;nbsp;That takes a bit of getting used to. &amp;nbsp;You meet with a counselor, who answers some of your questions, and annoyingly avoids others, giving you the impression that things may have really, seriously changed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this is an idea you're used to, right? &amp;nbsp;After all, you consciously made this choice after reading on the subject and thinking long and hard about it, maybe discussing it with others, making a real financial commitment to the payments. &amp;nbsp;You wondered, more than once, what it would be like, and what you should do. &amp;nbsp;Maybe you fight against the strictures a bit, since you're probably really neophilic enough to think the world changing entirely might be really cool. &amp;nbsp;When are the training wheels going to come off, so you can ascend to join the other superintelligences or crab-people or whatever?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But maybe you aren't like that. &amp;nbsp;Remember, this could happen not only to the dude (they're almost all dudes nowadays) who committed to cryogenics, but also to his family. &amp;nbsp;More to the point, &lt;b&gt;to his children&lt;/b&gt;. &amp;nbsp;I mean, good for him, not wanting to deny them future life. &amp;nbsp;But think about it:&amp;nbsp;what happens if they die before they grow up all the way? &amp;nbsp;Imagine going through this process, except you never finished high school, or elementary school before kicking it. &amp;nbsp;Shit, imagine dying before you can talk. &amp;nbsp;Maybe in the near future, people might get policies early enough that SIDS will be covered. &amp;nbsp;Imagine &lt;i&gt;growing up&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;in a situation like that. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or maybe they wouldn't be made to grow up in it. &amp;nbsp;Maybe if you're young enough, you haven't formed clear or rigid enough models for the world to resist this new strange world, whatever it is. &amp;nbsp;Maybe human babies humans can just just be tossed a series of physical and mental extensions to be made into starbabies. &amp;nbsp;And hell, we've figured out that &lt;a href="http://www.livescience.com/health/051227_neuron_growth.html"&gt;people actually can grow new neurons into adulthood&lt;/a&gt;, so maybe the greater context that experience grants adult gives them stability rather than brittleness. &amp;nbsp;Maybe there's an easy path out for adults.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what about the kids who fall between, neither young enough to rapidly forget their humanity, nor old enough to keep an unaided grip on their sanity through the revelations? &amp;nbsp;What if they need a customized process? &amp;nbsp;What if, especially, they become really antsy and afraid unless they think they're surrounded by other mostly normal people? &amp;nbsp;Remember, even though the whole family had the insurance, they might have all died at different times, or in such a way that only the kid was recovered, or that their family was recovered &amp;nbsp;and integrated a while ago (better preserved bodies, I mean), or maybe it was just determined that being grouped in a simulation with anyone you know is counterproductive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or...there might be gaps in memory caused directly by physical trauma or decay, and if the technology is sufficiently advanced (oh, say it can be!), there might also be traumatic memories which are blanked, whether of one's death, or of one's family, or even of anything the Intelligences (I'm not married to that terminology) deem to be damaging. &amp;nbsp;Pain, deprivation, or outright abuse might be blocked. &amp;nbsp;Or maybe more sophisticated memetic science would identify memories or associations that we might think benign. &amp;nbsp;Taunts and&amp;nbsp;embarrassment? &amp;nbsp;Religious indoctrination? &amp;nbsp;Wetting the bed?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps all those gaps in memory would be too alarming. &amp;nbsp;Maybe they'd be smoothed over, so that you didn't notice what you didn't remember, or maybe they'd be outright replaced with less damaging ones. &amp;nbsp;Of course, it would be terrible (I think) for those memories to be covered up forever. &amp;nbsp;What kind of post humans would they grow up to be if they couldn't incorporate all their own experiences, their true "natures?" &amp;nbsp;Maybe their memories would be gradually revealed to be false, with the new ones rising to the surface, when "therapy" was complete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's what they would need, in essence. &amp;nbsp;Therapy. &amp;nbsp;The purpose of school has always been to indoctrinate children into being good members of their class and nation. &amp;nbsp;What if it was its primary focus was emotional development? &amp;nbsp;A rapid path to adulthood, independent of such easily-fixed things as knowing how to drive, or being of a certain age...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, right. &amp;nbsp;In case the title didn't give it away, &amp;nbsp;I'm trying to stack assumptions such that I can let all these kids go to "school" with one another. &amp;nbsp;In my mind, at the moment, it looks a bit like&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;The Sixth Sense &lt;/i&gt;meets &lt;i&gt;Revolutionary Girl Utena&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;crossed with&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Ender's Game&lt;/i&gt;, with all the kids essentially living inside "The Giant's Drink." &amp;nbsp;Or else, in game terminology, it's &lt;i&gt;lacuna&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;(no, not &lt;i&gt;Blue Lacuna, &lt;/i&gt;though that's a good thought...do they explore multiple worlds and modalities, rising through the layers gradually until they're ever closer to the truth?) meets &lt;i&gt;Bliss Stage&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;meets&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Grey Ranks&lt;/i&gt;, except there's no war but an internal one...although that might still seem threatening to them! &amp;nbsp;Growing up, extending beyond yourself and changing who you are, can hurt!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They're of a variety of ages, ranging from...let's say 8 to 16. &amp;nbsp;And they were all definitely alive during different stretches of time...potentially very different. &amp;nbsp;At least between today and fifty years from now. &amp;nbsp;And they're being guided, prodded,&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;shaped &lt;/i&gt;by literally impossible-to-understand forces (post-humans would think &lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;better&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;than us, not just faster). &amp;nbsp;Even if we accept as given that those forces are&amp;nbsp;beneficent&amp;nbsp;(okay, how about just hedonistic and gregarious?), won't the kids be in a fascinating situation?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cool? &amp;nbsp;Not cool? &amp;nbsp;Story? &amp;nbsp;Game?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Nick</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html'

scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='gaming'/><title type='text'>Blizzcon 2009 Part 5: The Starcraft App Store</title><content type='html'>In part 4, I talked some about &lt;i&gt;Starcraft 2&lt;/i&gt;, but mostly just in the context of the broader Battle.net strategy. &amp;nbsp;Now, you're going to hear some Starcraft-specific stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did get to play the game (specifically, a teeny part of the Terran campaign), and it's as good or better than you hope. &amp;nbsp;But there's only one aspect of the game sufficiently mind-blowing to be worth the time you're spending to read this article. &amp;nbsp;Let's see how long I can dance around it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Starcraft&lt;/i&gt; was an excellent, to borrow a meme from &lt;a href="http://www.actionbutton.net/"&gt;ActionButton&lt;/a&gt;, top-down fighting-game. &amp;nbsp;Many people played and enjoyed it as such. &amp;nbsp;But it came with editing tools that let players make maps with "triggers," condition-reaction pairs that, when combined in sufficient numbers, enabled different forms of gameplay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remember two very simple examples included with the game. &amp;nbsp;There was "Zergling Roundup," where you directed a single flamethrower-unit to keep a hoppity alien inside a ring for as long as possible. &amp;nbsp;There was "Wokka Wokka," where one player directed a robot through a maze to find little yellow balls, and the others controlled aliens that hunted the robot through the maze (Hint: it was Pacman). &amp;nbsp;Imaginative and time-rich players found that they could make far more complex and impressive outings. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most important ones to this conversation were those in which the player(s) had to build defenses with which to survive successive timed waves of computer-controlled enemies. &amp;nbsp; These maps eventually evolved into the modern game-form of Tower Defense: enemies approach along predetermined paths, use money to place and upgrade interlocking structures that kill them before they complete their pilgrimage, gaining more money to etc etc etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The genre proved popular. &amp;nbsp;Popular enough that there were designers who wanted more control and design variations than were possible in a &lt;i&gt;Starcraft&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;custom map, moved on to other platforms, most notably Flash, of which there are now approximately fourty hojillion examples mobbing every extant flash portal. &amp;nbsp;Popular enough, in fact, that they have become packaged commercial efforts, worth the money that people pay for them. &amp;nbsp;I highly recommend &lt;a href="http://studioeres.com/immortal/immortaldefense"&gt;Immortal Defense&lt;/a&gt;, myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that all took a while. &amp;nbsp;In the meantime, Blizzard had released&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Warcraft 3&lt;/i&gt;, another top-down fighting game, which&amp;nbsp;ran with the custom map concept. much, much further. &amp;nbsp;People made far more sophisticated maps, culminating in &lt;i&gt;Defense of the Ancients&lt;/i&gt;, in which ten players on two teams choose between dozens of unique hero classes and charge about a complex map full of computer-controlled allies and enemies, accumulating experience and gold, leveling up and warring with one another until one team's home base (you guessed it, the "ancient" of the title) is destroyed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(You know it's serious when I have to italicize it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"DotA" maps rapidly became the most popular type of custom map played in &lt;i&gt;Warcraft 3.&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;Then it became the most popular map of any kind; that is, &lt;i&gt;Defense of the Ancients&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;became vastly more popular than &lt;i&gt;Warcraft 3&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The DotA play genre is more complicated and long-form than tower defense, requiring more from both players and developers, so it's no surprise that it hasn't proliferated as much. &amp;nbsp;But some of the people responsible for DotA Allstars, now the DotA gold standard, are making &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Legends:_Clash_of_Fates"&gt;their own game&lt;/a&gt;, which I expect to be absurdly profitable, thanks to a low cost of development, marketing and distribution. &amp;nbsp;And then there's &lt;i&gt;Demigod&lt;/i&gt;, an honest-to-goodness AAA $50-60 title clearly pitched to the DotA community.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, lesson in the history of obscure gaming subcultures is over. &amp;nbsp;Pop quiz. &amp;nbsp;Given that Blizzard has made games whose communities have given rise to &lt;b&gt;entire (mostly) new genres of play&lt;/b&gt;, what are their goals with the custom map-making capabilities of &lt;i&gt;Starcraft 2&lt;/i&gt;?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, of course, you'd think they'd want even better customization. &amp;nbsp;And certainly, you'd be right.  Let's roll that beautiful bean footage:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;object height="344" width="425"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/joNPrnY4K_4&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/joNPrnY4K_4&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary (in case you can't watch the video right now): you can use the "map" editor to make a third-person action game with RPG elements, or a top-down scrolling shooter, and that's just for starters! &amp;nbsp;You can import your own models, textures and sound effects.  You can use the editor to create games that are not limited to the command interface or camera posititioning of the top-down fighting game.  You could make &lt;i&gt;Pong&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;with the damn thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's not just a game, it's a development platform.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that's not so terribly crazy, because we've seen games that are development platforms before. &amp;nbsp;It's just that they've always been first-person shooters, since that genre has always led the way in fast, detailed rendering of 3D graphics, and it was eventually realized that there was no great loss in letting another company make a game using the engine you custom-made for your own, as long as they pay the licensing fees. &amp;nbsp;In fact, there is a family of companies who now make engines as their primary business, with the occasional game acting as an interactive showroom for the features of the newest product. &amp;nbsp;Hence the&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Unreal Tournament&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Crysis&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;series, and most especially, &lt;i&gt;Half-life&lt;/i&gt; and&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Half-life 2&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Half-lifes are also engines masquerading as (very good) games, but&amp;nbsp;creator Valve Software has taken a slightly different approach to the business model . &amp;nbsp;Rather than supporting the high-paying development houses looking to drop art assets into a pre-made engine and push out a multi-million dollar AAA title, Valve releases free tools to everyone, and waits to see what happens. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I say that like we don't already know what happens. &amp;nbsp;id Software let people modify its flagship 3D product &lt;i&gt;Quake&lt;/i&gt;, and computer-mediated gaming has never recovered from the shock. &amp;nbsp;It turns out that there are vastly more talented and creative folks with free time on their hands out there than our game software industries are able to efficiently use, so kids and folks working in their free time can make astounding things played the world over. &amp;nbsp;Just as also was happening in (some people made games like &lt;i&gt;Warcraft 3&lt;/i&gt; using &lt;i&gt;Half-life&lt;/i&gt;, but no one could have done the opposite). &amp;nbsp;And that's certainly what happened with Valve's offerings: several mods became immensely popular, almost being seen as their own games.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it wasn't entirely surprising that Valve encouraged the teams responsible for those mods to actually release them as stand-alone games. &amp;nbsp;Hence &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dayofdefeat.com/"&gt;Day of Defeat Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;and the inestimable &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.counter-strike.net/"&gt;Counter-Strike Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. &amp;nbsp;Hence &lt;i&gt;Team Fortress 2&lt;/i&gt;, made by the developers of a Quake mod so unnaturally popular, Valve hired them outright, which has proven to be extremely savvy. &amp;nbsp;TF2 is the WoW of its genre, the gold standard and the cultural touchstone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So Valve encouraged the monetization of the excitement and creativity of its fans by giving away a development platform, which proved popular. &amp;nbsp;But by far their most popular innovation has been the creation of &lt;a href="http://www.steampowered.com/"&gt;Steam&lt;/a&gt;, a publishing platform for low cost-of-entry digital distribution, which makes it even easier for just about anyone to sell the games they make.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the panel on map editing which I attended at Blizzcon, all of these things (Steam, Day of Defeat, Team Fortress) were being shown on slides. &amp;nbsp;So was the iPhone app store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within &lt;i&gt;Starcraft 2&lt;/i&gt;, you will find an interface letting you upload your custom "maps" (remember, they can essentially be games of their own) to a central repository, and also an interface for browsing that repository. &amp;nbsp;The maps can be dowloaded, reviewed, commented upon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;And they can be sold!&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;Money can change hands! &amp;nbsp;Most will be free, of course, because free works typically sit at a level of quality which requires less effort, but if you want, you can gather a team of friends, make a custom interface and custom models and custom sound effects...an entire game, all your own, and sell it via &lt;i&gt;Starcraft 2&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The message is clear: they've learned their lesson. &amp;nbsp;Once (twice, actually) upon a time, while polishing a lamp, a genie came rushing out with a great *whoosh*, escaping to frolic in the ether. &amp;nbsp;The next great new gameplay genre, made by the next enterprising Blizzard fan, may not feel the need to escape the confines of its originating game. &amp;nbsp;Blizzard has asked themselves: "What does coding Flash and C++ have that making custom maps doesn't, and how much of that can we recreate?" &amp;nbsp;And so they have provided support for new art assets and control schemes, and then added the bonus of a fully realized digital distribution system, including the ability to make money. &amp;nbsp;Their goal is to make sure that it takes much longer before (or happens much less often that) a hypothetical developer decides they want to go it alone, to re-make their great idea in a fashion that doesn't contribute, even indirectly, to Blizzard. &amp;nbsp;Of all the millions of people who've played Tower Defense games, how many know where it came from? &amp;nbsp;What would have happened if even ten percent of those games were available only via &lt;i&gt;Starcraft&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;or &lt;i&gt;Warcraft 3&lt;/i&gt;? &amp;nbsp;What would have happened if the immense success of DotA had been tracked, noticed sooner, and marketed/co-opted?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't judge them harshly for taking action for further market share and control of products inspired by their products: the ability of a company to give back-scratchers to its customers is also their ability to get their back scratched, if you follow me. &amp;nbsp;Give and get. &amp;nbsp;Ask and receive. &amp;nbsp;Make a big enough tent and watch people start a circus. &amp;nbsp;This is the way of modern game development.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Nick</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2009/09/blizzcon-2009-part-5-starcraft-app.html#comment-form' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/4434022867741775621'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/4434022867741775621'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2009/09/blizzcon-2009-part-5-starcraft-app.html' title='Blizzcon 2009 Part 5: The Starcraft App Store'/><author><name>Nick Novitski</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08863651199447917923</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>2</thr:total><georss:featurename>Convention Center, Anaheim, CA, USA</georss:featurename><georss:point>33.7999308 -117.9205064</georss:point><georss:box>33.7820998 -117.9496889 33.8177618 -117.89132389999999</georss:box></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31707300.post-7747749788627081841</id><published>2009-09-10T10:46:00.000-04:00</published><updated>2009-09-10T10:46:43.673-04:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Interactive Fiction Suggestions, Fall 2009</title><content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://nickm.com/post/2009/09/interactive-fiction-suggestions-fall-2009/"&gt;Interactive Fiction Suggestions, Fall 2009&lt;/a&gt;: "&lt;p&gt;People who are interested in interactive fiction but who haven’t played much or any of it ask me for suggestions from time to time — not as often as I’d &lt;i&gt;like,&lt;/i&gt; of course, but, luckily, once in a while. I’ve had a page of recommendations up on my site since 2005. The games on that list remain good ones, but I’m now updating those recommendations to take into account games from recent years, and, I’m posting the new ones here. Note that many of the people who ask me about IF are of a literary bent, as am I, and my suggestions reflect that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;A good introduction to interactive fiction does not have to be easy or simple. A game that you have to restart several times, and that you can only scratch the surface of after a few hours of effort, may show you, by being intricate and compelling, why it’s really worthwhile to try to meet the challenges of IF. It seems most important to me that a piece of IF quickly gives a sense of the powerful, interesting play of simulation and language. Such a game might happen to be hard or easy. On the other hand, some good games rely on a player knowing about IF conventions and even particular earlier games, characters, or puzzles. These often aren’t good places for someone to start. There are many good commercial games from the 1980s and some from more recent times, but in my main list, I’ve limited myself to games that authors have made available for free download.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although it’s possible to play some IF on the Web, it’s really best to use an interpreter to run all of this interactive fiction; the interpreter is to IF as the Flash player is to Flash and the Web browser is to the Web. There are good interpreters for Windows (&lt;a href="http://ccxvii.net/gargoyle/"&gt;Gargoyle&lt;/a&gt;) and Mac OS X (&lt;a href="http://ccxvii.net/spatterlight/"&gt;Spatterlight&lt;/a&gt;) that run IF in all of the major formats; you can also find interpreters for Linux and for smartphones. There are plenty of things you can read to help you play interactive fiction — one that I’d particularly suggest is Emily Short’s &lt;a href="http://inform-fiction.org/I7Downloads/Examples/dm/IntroductionToIF.pdf"&gt;PDF introducing interactive fiction&lt;/a&gt; — but if you have the chance to play together with someone who knows the conventions of IF and has played a few games before, that will surely be the best way to get into IF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are my suggestions for eager first-time IF players, organized by year of release:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.wurb.com/if/game/17"&gt;Anchorhead&lt;/a&gt; by Michael Gentry, 1998&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;A sprawling horror based on the mythos of H.P. Lovecraft, with exquisite attention to detail and compelling characters and places.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~dbs/bmch.html"&gt;Bad Machine&lt;/a&gt; by Dan Shiovitz, 1999&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The surface of this game seems to be a confusion of code, error messages, and a bit of of English, but its strange science fiction world is deeply systematic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dfan.org/IF/#change"&gt;For a Change&lt;/a&gt; by Dan Schmidt, 1999&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schmidt’s game programming is better known thanks to &lt;i&gt;Guitar Hero&lt;/i&gt; but before he coded that up he was inspired by Ben Marcus’s &lt;i&gt;The Age of Wire and String&lt;/i&gt; and wrote this piece of interactive fiction, which features an odd lexicon and curious, magical assemblages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://adamcadre.ac/varicella.html"&gt;Varicella&lt;/a&gt; by Adam Cadre, 1999&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;A sort of revenge-play, difficult, complex, and worth several attempts. A strange palace holds intrigues, surprises, an array of excellent characters who wander and plot against the player character, the palace minister.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.eblong.com/zarf/if.html#shade"&gt;Shade&lt;/a&gt; by Andrew Plotkin, 2000&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most famous “one room game in your apartment.” What seems to be a sleepless night undergoes a disturbing transformation as the character, undertaking ordinary actions, uncovers a different reality. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.peccable.com/current/if.shtml#slouching"&gt;Slouching towards Bedlam&lt;/a&gt; by Daniel Ravipinto and Star C. Foster, 2003&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;An intricate steampunk piece with that deals with insanity and language and offer several different concluding threads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.aaronareed.net/telling.html"&gt;Whom the Telling Changed&lt;/a&gt; by Aaron Reed, 2005&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;A reframing and reworking of &lt;i&gt;Gilgamesh,&lt;/i&gt; the first known epic, which combines elements of hypertext-like word selection with the usual command-based IF interface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.inform-fiction.org/I7Downloads/Examples/bronze/"&gt;Bronze&lt;/a&gt; by Emily Short, 2006&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reworks the beauty and the beast legend, embedding memories in an architectural space in compelling ways. It has a special “novice mode” and a status-line compass that will aid players in understanding and navigating IF locations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.grunk.org/lostpig/"&gt;Lost Pig (And Place Under Ground)&lt;/a&gt; by Admiral Jota, 2007&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;A hilarious underground romp that bring every major type of puzzle together in miniature form. The really wonderful aspect is the orcish, semi-literate narration that is used throughout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.wurb.com/if/game/3173"&gt;Violet&lt;/a&gt; by Jeremy Freese, 2008&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;A graduate student locks himself in his office to try trying to make progress on his dissertation. The puzzles, as the player seeks to overcome distraction, are amusing, but the atmosphere and the voice of the character’s absent, imagined girlfriend are extraordinary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I still like all of the pieces I originally suggested, but, in the interests of bringing in some newer games while making only ten main suggestions, I’m moved these here: &lt;i&gt;Aisle,&lt;/i&gt; by Sam Barlow, 1999; &lt;i&gt;Dangerous Curves,&lt;/i&gt; by Irene Callaci. 2000; &lt;i&gt;The Edifice,&lt;/i&gt; by Lucian Paul Smith, 1999. &lt;i&gt;Savoir-Faire,&lt;/i&gt; by Emily Short, 2002. And, in case you feel comfortable obtaining (previously) commercial games from abandonware sites or want to quest for them on eBay, I’ll also mention &lt;i&gt;A Mind Forever Voyaging, by Steven Meretzky, Infocom, 1985; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mindwheel,&lt;/i&gt; by Robert Pinsky, Brøderbund/Synapse, 1984; &lt;i&gt;Suspended,&lt;/i&gt; by Michael Berlyn, Infocom, 1983; &lt;i&gt;Trinity,&lt;/i&gt; by Brian Moriarty, Infocom, 1986; and &lt;i&gt;Wishbringer,&lt;/i&gt; by Brian Moriarty, Infocom, 1985. Note that reading or at least looking over the documentation to these commercial games is often very useful, and sometimes essential, in getting started with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does anyone else have other good IF starting points to suggest? Or, does anyone want to report experiences of delight or frustration with one of these ten games?&lt;/p&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Nick&lt;/p&gt;</content><link

(regardless of whether Duckburg and related environs are located in America), with their Scottish, English and Dutch ancestry, mixed and entangled over the course of the hard-scrabble yet hugely enriching life in the new world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking over this ridiculous picture makes me (I know, I know) want to know the stories of the rest of the duck family. &amp;nbsp;I suddenly realize there is no &lt;i&gt;Blackadder&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;RPG, to my knowledge. &amp;nbsp;That is, a game where you play through a multigenerational series of vignettes that are unified by all the principal characters being descendants/ancestors of one another. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Yes,&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Blackadder &lt;/i&gt;is hardly the only example of the type of story I mean, but it has the double advantages of being funny and British.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every game of &lt;a href="http://www.lamemage.com/blog/index.php/category/microscope/"&gt;Microscope&lt;/a&gt; I've ever heard of involved aliens, monsters and oh my, but nothing stops an interested group from having a "narrower" focus. &amp;nbsp;That might be the one to try, but subdued, un-gonzo gaming may not be the specialty of my current groups. &amp;nbsp;Then again, I wouldn't mind a gonzo multigenerational story. &amp;nbsp;Something like &lt;i&gt;Accelerando&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;or &lt;i&gt;Legend of the

type='text'>Cities can walk, too</title><content type='html'>Hello. &amp;nbsp;You don't know me, and very little about me should matter to you, except that I live in &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ones_Who_Walk_Away_from_Omelas"&gt;Omelas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might have heard of us. &amp;nbsp;I hope you have, because explaining it to the unfamiliar usually involves a lot of sceptical snorts and&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;suffice it to say that the city is constructed such that everything is exceptionally well-managed, prosperous and at peace, so long as in one lightless room one unfortunate child is kept sick, starved, and devoid of pleasant contact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;oh, and also, such that everyone is aware of the ineluctable causal link between the sequestering and the prospering. &amp;nbsp;And, of course, that everyone is aware of&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recall a paper in a scientific journal concerning just how much better life was here than elsewhere. &amp;nbsp;it had been buried further in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and some twinge of civic pride prompts me to tell you that it rhymes with "lace," not "lass." &amp;nbsp;So sorry, very common and understandable mistake. &amp;nbsp;Most people don't know where the city is, of course, so they are to be quite forgiven for thinking that English is spoken there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which it is, of course, by those who learn it. &amp;nbsp;My first degree was actually in English Literature, though I specialized in&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My reference to scientific journals has already betrayed me as a pedant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's as&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realized that I would eventually come to not think about it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I was going to have to set down the problem eventually, how could I&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So of course, I endeavored to free the unfortunate. &amp;nbsp;And yes, he did have a name, and a past and a purpose, but again, his significance to you is confined to his role in this story. &amp;nbsp;Try as I might, I don't feel as if I can ever bridge the gap between this accurate language required of ethical balancing-acts and the simple reality of another person's touch. &amp;nbsp;It's like reaching for your own hand in the mirror: you feel a smooth and horribly perfect barrier&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You'd be surprised at how easy it was. &amp;nbsp;Though in this I assume you aren't Omelassian, in which case you would say "Well we never thought anyone would &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;something about it!" &amp;nbsp;To which your response might be to laugh, because you will think of it in all kinds of improper analogies. &amp;nbsp;You might imagine - it's the one I've heard the most - a fantastic power plant which uses some sort of easy-to-transport fuel, and which produces incredible results&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, there never were any clear numbers, but judging from birth and citizenship records, it's safe to say far more people stayed, became reconciled to the situation, than ever left the city. &amp;nbsp;And by definition, nearly 100% of the&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dub it Ethical Inertia: it is less demanding to tolerate suffering than to inflict it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Nick</content><link rel='edit'

decided on a semi-whim to buy a dinner from Flippin' Pizza, and found it to be further and slower than I anticipated. &amp;nbsp;And then I had to leave to watch the Ducks get STOMPED into Boise's blue turf. &amp;nbsp;Yeesh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But while I was there, I did get to read and run &lt;i&gt;Action Castle&lt;/i&gt;, the first published game with the Parsley system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parsley a Jared Sornenson joint, and is most easily explained if you're already familiar with Interactive Fiction/Text Adventure games, in which case all I need to say is "The GM acts as the parser for a simple game, and the players take turns entering lines of input."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you aren't...well, the players all control one character, designed as part of the adventure, which consists of a list of locations, key items, and situations that can be passed through the correct use of those items. &amp;nbsp;The players take turns giving single commands to the GM, who claims to only understand a certain standard, simple grammar and list of nouns. &amp;nbsp;Things like:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&amp;gt;t&lt;b&gt;ake shortsword&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;You don't see that here.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&amp;gt;t&lt;b&gt;ake sword&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;You now have the sword.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;b&gt;&amp;gt;slay troll with sword&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;I don't understand the word 'slay.'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;b&gt;eat troll&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;You have died. &amp;nbsp;You scored 30 out of a possible 100 points. &amp;nbsp;(N)ew Game/(R)estore/(Q)uit?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;You can compare the experience to a real-time &lt;a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/"&gt;MS Paint Adventure&lt;/a&gt;, but of course with words rather than pictures. &amp;nbsp;(Incidentally, one of the players felt compelled to draw a map and inventory, which I found very in keeping with the spirit of the exercise.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of this is expected to be improvised by a GM who has a-studied his Infocom, which I haf. &amp;nbsp;Being conversant in the standards of the form, I was able to fill in the framework presented by the Adventure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Action Castle is printed on two sides of a stiff tri-fold pamphlet. One side has the Parsley rules (basic and special commands, general GM advice), and the other has the map and basic room descriptions. &amp;nbsp;As a result, it's quite short, with no more "puzzles" than can be counted on one hand. &amp;nbsp;The next &lt;a href="http://lacunastory.com/"&gt;Blue Lacuna&lt;/a&gt; it is not. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that's hardly the point! &amp;nbsp;The fun came in with the players (there were two) experimenting with the world, and my improvising responses to their ideas. &amp;nbsp;And it was fun, though I have some advice for my past self (and future others who might like to GM it), and one..."complaint" would be too strong of a word.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problem first. &amp;nbsp;The players were not familiar with text-interface games, and therefore one of the cute tricks that the adventure plays on them, which I suspect would be rapidly solved by a veteran player, stymied them to the point that they quit the game and only came back with my encouragement. &amp;nbsp;I'm not sure how I feel about the placement of this "puzzle" &amp;nbsp;(if you play or read it, I suspect you'll immediately know the one I mean)&amp;nbsp;in a product that sends visual signals of "Play With Your Friends!" and "Fun For All Ages!" &amp;nbsp;I attempted to fix the problem with the same kind of hints that you'd find in the best kinds of IF: when things didn't work, I tried to suggest the. &amp;nbsp;Without spoiling it (since I still recommend the game), that approach had a low chance of working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I'm going to go out on a limb and say that even if the players had given up and stopped playing then, the impossible methods that they were attempting to use to alternately solve the problem were very fun to narrate through. &amp;nbsp;Even when they tricked me into killing the guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, that's the first bit of advice: the first virtue of a parser is to &lt;b&gt;be consistent&lt;/b&gt;. &amp;nbsp;I did this well when, after I had established that the cottage had a thatched roof, and the strange candle's flame gave off heat, and the roof could be lit on fire and eventually bun down, and the unconscious guard could be dragged or pushed to different locations, that...well, you can probably already guess what happened. &amp;nbsp;Let's pull a veil on that horror, except to say that I had already prevented them from dropping him off the bridge, and I realized later that I shouldn't have bothered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I did fail to do it right when I first said that the candle was unlit, and even said &amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;You don't see that here&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;when the players said &amp;gt;&lt;b&gt;light candle with fire&lt;/b&gt;, but then I forgot! &amp;nbsp;I talked about it as if&amp;nbsp;it was lit! Gah! &amp;nbsp;So don't do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good idea that I forgot at one point was to &lt;b&gt;keep descriptions&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;simple&lt;/b&gt;, as you may have to repeat them. &amp;nbsp;I trapped myself with my excitement of describing the thatch catching fire, and produced a loving description of the fire catching which I found I did not wish to repeat or remember &lt;i&gt;every fricking time &lt;/i&gt;the players reloaded and tried again. &amp;nbsp;Ditto on asking the princess questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either way, I'd definitely run it again, and making adventures for the system is remarkably simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Nick</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2009/09/action-castle.html#comment-form' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/1585999711352389164'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/1585999711352389164'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2009/09/action-castle.html' title='Action Castle'/><author><name>Nick Novitski</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08863651199447917923</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>2</thr:total><georss:featurename>Falls Church, VA, USA</georss:featurename><georss:point>38.882239 -77.170983</georss:point><georss:box>38.8655355 -77.20016550000001 38.8989425 -77.1418005</georss:box></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31707300.post-5178690800378170999</id><published>2009-09-02T19:48:00.002-04:00</published><updated>2009-09-10T13:48:15.100-04:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='sports'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='then I had some toast'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='stupid'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='google'/><title type='text'>Google Calendar gets sporty, drops ball</title><content type='html'>&lt;div&gt;Google Calendar does good work, so I was briefly excited by &lt;a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/OfficialGmailBlog/~3/BniM0B3-vPI/new-in-calendar-sports-schedules-and.html"&gt;the announcement that they'll make it easy for you to track world-wide sports schedules.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;But woe!  You can &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; subscribe to a given team's schedule! That's great for people who strongly identify with a certain team, but what if I just want the full NFL or Serie A schedule on my calendar?  Well, I have to subscribe to each team's feed, which means that my list of calendars gets cluttered and every event shows up twice (once for each of the teams playing). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is a pretty gross oversight, though I'm inclined to be forgiving, partly because it's some poor intern's pet project, and partly because it's easily fixed: just add an "All Events" entry at the lowest folder level.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In the meantime, you can always set up emailed reminders for every Oregon Ducks game, and even if it's not being shown in your area (likely), the event will automatically be updated with the score in real time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I was going to insert a joke here about the Southeastern Conference suing Google over that feature, but the merest touch of research told me that little storm-in-a-teapot actually boiled over with a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://blog.al.com/solomon/2009/08/sec_to_fans_tweeting_now_allow.html"&gt;sudden outbreak of common sense&lt;/a&gt;.

type='html'>Okay, the heavy stuff's out of the way. &amp;nbsp;Now I want to talk about some specific bits in the announced plans that were intriguing to me. &amp;nbsp;Blizzard, as I said in part 1, is staffed by serious professional folks what think hard about their goals and efforts. &amp;nbsp;That their games will be at least "good" is a foregone conclusion. &amp;nbsp;What attracts me is the parts that will be new or different, or which give insight into what direction these serious hard-thinkers see the marketplace of play going in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I want to talk about is how they want to leverage their fan base into a social network.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of old, Blizzard games which were played online used an in-game matchmaking service called "Battle.net." &amp;nbsp;There had been games that could be played with across local and non-local networks before, and there had been external applications that polled available game servers and launched the game with a double-click, but Battle.net was the first time a company said "it is part of our game that you play with everyone else who has our game."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the beginning until its last major release, it has taken the same basic form: you can click the "connect to battle.net" button (next to and below the "play alone" and "play with people close by" buttons), you're asked to log in, and then are carried to a set of chat channels for everyone who's connected at that moment (private channels optional), as well as a tool for searching and filtering the games currently being run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new design is primarily inspired by the two communication paradigms that displaced the chat channel: the instant messenger, and the profile page w/status updates. &amp;nbsp;Well, I admit that the use of the word "paradigm" is my own sin; the designers at the panel were practical enough to instead list examples they thought "worked well": Google Talk and Facebook (as well as the current premier online-game-serving platforms, XBox Live and Steam).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would characterize the strategy as to make Battle.net, to the limits of the particular game, no longer a separate "type" of play, but melded to the core experience as closely as possible: social play becoming an extension of play. &amp;nbsp;Or, rather, the social play which has always existed becoming co-opted as much as possible. &amp;nbsp;It has always been the case that even games which you play by yourself, you discuss with friends (or, at least, barring severe anxieties, would enjoy discussing with friends). &amp;nbsp;People will try to tell you that the only interaction between players of &lt;i&gt;Donkey Kong&lt;/i&gt; was to displace one another on the high score list, but that's bullshit: &lt;i&gt;Donkey Kong&lt;/i&gt; players interacted all the time, whenever they met and spoke to one another and counted &lt;i&gt;Donkey Kong&lt;/i&gt; among their shared passions. &amp;nbsp;Do we say that only music played in concerts is social? &amp;nbsp;Do readers of books lack a shared culture, because they necessarily pursue their hobby alone? &amp;nbsp;All that's being attempted is to make the game include a convenient nexus for that excitement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this is all by way of letting you down easy. &amp;nbsp;The ire-raising truth is: not only will you only be able to play &lt;i&gt;Starcraft 2&lt;/i&gt; with other people via Battle.net, you won't even play it &lt;i&gt;alone&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;without it. &amp;nbsp;In the future, all Blizzard games will start by asking you to log in to the service, much as &lt;i&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/i&gt; does. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are many who will see this as an inconvenience and imposition. &amp;nbsp;For some of these people, it will be true. &amp;nbsp;But modern gaming has been vastly enhanced by an at least intermittent internet connection for some time now, and tens of millions of people play games that require them. &amp;nbsp;Can't close the barn door after the ship has sailed, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are compensatory advantages. &amp;nbsp;First, as with &lt;i&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/i&gt;, all the data particular to your account can be saved on remote servers, accessible no matter what computer you use. &amp;nbsp;Get to level 4 at work, then play up to level 6 on your desktop at home, then get on your Virgin America cross-country flight with GoGo wireless internet service and power through the rest on your laptop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Dear Richard Branson: I heart your airline.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second is the&amp;nbsp;Facebook wrinkle I was mentioning before: "friend" will become a tiered concept. &amp;nbsp;Currently, in World of Warcraft, it is possible to add any character you meet to a "friends list," which essentially acts as a list of quick-dial contact information. &amp;nbsp;So if level 76 paladin "xXxDethStrikexXx" turned out (incredibly) to be a pleasure to play with, you can make a personal note of it, after which point you can see at a glance if they are online, and call them up later to play with again. &amp;nbsp;Which is good, because it is possible to make friends via the game. &amp;nbsp;But recall that&amp;nbsp;the aforementioned paladin is only one character, whose player might switch back and forth between several others. &amp;nbsp;If you only know him as the paladin, you won't recognize his warlock. &amp;nbsp;This especially becomes a problem when you're trying to connect to people whom you know in real life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hence the concept of "Real ID," a social-network-style friending that lets consenting users connect via their Battle.net accounts. &amp;nbsp;You can search for people by their email address, after which point they show up in your friends list under the real name by which you know them. &amp;nbsp;And since all future Blizzard games will be using Battle.net, you'll be able to send them messages even if you're playing &lt;i&gt;Starcraft&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;and they're playing &lt;i&gt;Diablo&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with Facebook, the system will also support status updates (are we going to someday give up and just call them "tweets," in the same way adhesive strips became "band-aids"?) broadcast to all your Real ID friends, and you'll even get a notifications feed as your friends get achievements in whatever-they-happen-to-be-playing. &amp;nbsp;Or&amp;nbsp;you can always go to your friends profile page to see all the achievements they've gotten in supported Blizzard games, doubtless with further unannounced (possibly undesigned) functionality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battle.net already ties into the official Blizzard store, allowing you to download and re-download any games you purchase from them or register with them, and the official Blizzard forum, awarding you with icons/avatars corresponding to your WoW character's appearance. &amp;nbsp;That feature is slated to be expanded: many &lt;i&gt;Starcraft 2 &lt;/i&gt;achievements will award specific icons for your profile, and with a common achievement system across all games, adding that functionality to &lt;i&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;is probably inevitable. &amp;nbsp;As well, the icons could be made usable in-game: when you play&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Starcraft 2&lt;/i&gt;,&amp;nbsp;all your units and buildings will be painted with your chosen mark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, Battle.net is to become integral to the Blizzard brand: a platform for collecting and focusing the thousand suns of fan creativity and excitement, and a part of what makes each game good. &amp;nbsp;I suspect that most people will adjust to the move, as long as the service lives up to the usability expectations set by the games (and really, an interface is an interface is an interface). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there are and will be critics. &amp;nbsp;In fact, I spoke to one just after the Battle.net panel. &amp;nbsp;To paraphrase our conversation:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"I don't like that. &amp;nbsp;I don't want my friends to be messaging me when I'm raiding."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Well, you can just ignore them."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"No, my friends are really insistent."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Well, you can just tell them that you're busy, and that you can't talk right now. &amp;nbsp;You could even set your status to that, so they'd know why you can't play with them."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;"You don't know my friends."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"I hope I never do."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Nick</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html'

bit shall go unquestioned today, because their racial mounts shall be little roadsters with spiky wheels and racoon tails. &amp;nbsp;And my big black Tauren, Haquim, will have one, and ride about in

0px;"&gt;Comic relief quota met.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me be frank with you: &amp;nbsp;POCs are thin on the ground in the Blizzard staff, or rather they are, like the Air Up There, thinner the higher you go. &amp;nbsp;The Diablo art panel was composed of a representative from each of six art teams, and each representative began his (of course, his) alloted time by sharing the names and faces of the team members who were not chosen to be outward-facing. &amp;nbsp;I watched these faces carefully, because I wanted to confirm a hypothesis about the Witch Doctor.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the ways that the Diablo series&amp;nbsp;distinguishes itself from the fantasy fiction games it heavily borrows from is via a bit of creative destruction of options. &amp;nbsp;As in D&amp;amp;D, players choose a "class" of hero at the beginning of the game. &amp;nbsp;Unlike in freely described analog games, Diablo players are limited in how their hero presents, visually. &amp;nbsp;In fact, they are restricted to a single look, without any kind of customization: All Barbarians are the same barbarian, all Amazons are the same amazon (and don't try to tell them that Amazons&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;barbarians), all Necromancers etc. &amp;nbsp;But by keeping the player from throwing together "their own" character, the focus can be shifted: each hero comes from a specific, real place. &amp;nbsp;"Barbarian" is a suitably generic name for a D&amp;amp;D class (so much so that it in fact&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt;), but the game tells you that these particular barbarians are from a particular mountain and have a particular (not very barbaric) culture, and legends, and why your barbarian is especially great and what he's looking for. &amp;nbsp;And in Diablo 2, you actually visit the homes of some of the heroes, where everyone dresses like they did, and the circle is complete, and it feels as if each game is a mural in a temple to the fiction, the world which is in fact called Sanctuary, as if it were a temple, or perhaps each game is a book in a library we painstakingly put together, like inveterate plot dispenser Deckard Cain, or the ubiquitous archivists in each game who leave behind the quest texts and manuals and website updates. &amp;nbsp;It might even be that each game is an immense yet lovingly careful brush-stroke on the canvas of our minds which will eventually compose an incredible tapestry...but I'm knee deep in metaphors and mixing up my creative mediums already. &amp;nbsp;Tapestries have threads, not strokes.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The point is, classes were cultures. &amp;nbsp;When we understood that fully, even those heroes whose homes had not been visited implied entire nations with the mere cut of their dress, the turn of their phrase and, inevitably, the color of their skin.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the original &lt;i&gt;Diablo&lt;/i&gt;, the Sorceror was black. &amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Diablo 2&lt;/i&gt; similarly had the Paladin. &amp;nbsp;In &lt;i&gt;Diablo 3&lt;/i&gt;, so far, the One-Dark-Person quota is fulfilled by the Witch Doctor.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both the male and female Witch Doctor models have a common look: emaciated, trembling as if with fever, ashy, mildly pot-bellied and scantily clad in the colorful, primitive raiment of their sinister culture. &amp;nbsp;So poor, sick and dirty, in general. &amp;nbsp;Oh, and black. &amp;nbsp;I almost forgot.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps you see my problem. &amp;nbsp;The phrase "witch doctor" (would "shaman" or "medicine man" have been too confusing?) is already fraught with racism, oppression, and nonsensical night-terrors of dirty, scary ethnic men in big masks with inscrutable powers of which we wot not. &amp;nbsp;And the visual language used by the art team does not fight this impression, except to explain breathlessly at the end, "...and isn't it &lt;i&gt;awesome&lt;/i&gt;?"&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe. &amp;nbsp;I don't think a thing being interesting &lt;i&gt;entirely&lt;/i&gt; cancels out it being offensive. &amp;nbsp;Or rather, I don't think anything should "cancel" anything, that all existences are complex, and no attributes are primary. &amp;nbsp;It excites, which is good, and it offends, which is bad.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Witch Doctor comes from the same strange new (to me, I suppose) racist place as the native's in Peter Jackson's &lt;i&gt;King Kong&lt;/i&gt;. &amp;nbsp;Jackson was playing into a slightly less typical racist narrative, a kind of&amp;nbsp;Theosophic-nouveau. &amp;nbsp;Skull Island, home of Kong, dinosaurs, and the mud-people (they are constantly covered in it, and seem to be made of it, as if they burst from foul pustules in the cursed earth like Uruk-hai), resembles a jungle at first glance, but almost every single geographic feature upon which that jungle grows is quite clearly a decaying building or an avenue or some other structure of incredible scale (though still, it's important to note, built with human proportions in mind) and detail. &amp;nbsp;There was...a city? &amp;nbsp;An empire? &amp;nbsp;A civilization, without a doubt, proudly unfathomed by our histories, and yet, as the poem says "&lt;i&gt;Nothing besides remains / The lone and level sands stretch far away&lt;/i&gt;".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But no, that's not right. &amp;nbsp;There is no sand, but a jungle, and jungle means "to rot." &amp;nbsp;Life on the island is riotous, prolific, but bottom-feeding, craving an influx of new energies as that of the closed system dwindles from the curse of finite efficiency. &amp;nbsp;This is late-stage life: vampiric, even qlippothic, too single-minded and pointless to be called "predatorial," macro-forms of the mindlessly feeding micro-organisms that live in our guts, skin, and eyes, loosed to feast upon our flesh and bones after some unknowable catastrophe felled the forces which kept them in check (white blood cells, or else giant gorillas). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus, even immense dinosaurs will go to absurd lengths to eat a single Girl with a Head Full of Dreams, or a Firm but Fair Black Captain. &amp;nbsp;Compared to them, we burn with a vitality that may see our civilization rise up the wheel even further, where they have already fallen. &amp;nbsp;Kong's full journey eventually makes the message abundantly clear: New York is the New Skull Island, Skull Island is the Old New York, and people may decide for themselves, when all is pulled down to dust, if our heights truly equalled those of he who roared his defiance in the face of our Air Corps fighter planes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll stop myself and refocus here, because an analysis of King Kong could easily by my own post: the natives encountered are degenerate, their teeth, skin and minds roil with rot, just like every other part of the island, and they crave the pristine, in order to sacrifice it as offering to the forces of entropy, embodied to them by Kong. &amp;nbsp;But they are the children of a people that once ruled their universe. &amp;nbsp;Despite their apparent debilitation, they are physically capable, pole-vaulting stealthily to and from a ship moored far from shore. &amp;nbsp;They are mentally tough as well, unfazed by things that we would revolt us...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry. &amp;nbsp;I am trying my best to place this in the spectrum of racism, to explain why no harm was meant by it, and less harm was done by it than by, say, Resident Evil 4. &amp;nbsp;Within the role the natives are to play, the fiction of Kong gives them power, significance. &amp;nbsp;So they're more like Lovecraft's Asians than his Negroes. &amp;nbsp;Gah! &amp;nbsp;Sorry!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yeah, I was bothered by the Witch Doctor, but I eventually settled into an unsteady truce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's switch games for a moment. &amp;nbsp;Here's a photo I took when I was wandering the art booth. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_4s_kbVFrc84/SpSriK1GrJI/AAAAAAAADNA/34VXs0m1Rws/s1600-h/IMG_0208.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_4s_kbVFrc84/SpSriK1GrJI/AAAAAAAADNA/34VXs0m1Rws/s320/IMG_0208.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you can see, it's an awesome-looking brother with dreads and a rifle some kind of super-stealth suit. &amp;nbsp;It's the un-post-racial version of Riddick, carrying around some trophies, mandibles or something from some alien scum he just straight &lt;i&gt;smoked&lt;/i&gt;. &amp;nbsp;As anyone can see, he's clearly a character of some kind for Starcraft 2; this was officially announced on Saturday as part of the voice acting panel, where the character's name was given ("Tosh," which leads me to believe that Blizzard under-values British localization), and where his voice actor was introduced. &amp;nbsp;The two share an eerie resemblance. &amp;nbsp;(No, not just because they're both black, they actually look related. &amp;nbsp;Ass.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was excited, at first, to finally see a second black man in the Starcraft universe. &amp;nbsp;That one guy from the opening Brood War cinematic's been pretty lonely the past near-decade, since all of his friends look like this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_4s_kbVFrc84/SpSsKO8gR-I/AAAAAAAADNI/xOcavUhGZvM/s1600-h/IMG_0209.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_4s_kbVFrc84/SpSsKO8gR-I/AAAAAAAADNI/xOcavUhGZvM/s320/IMG_0209.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(That's Tychus Findlay, redneck convict-conscript, a protagonist prominently featured in the &lt;i&gt;Starcraft 2&lt;/i&gt; trailer.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Before it's pointed out, I'm trying to ignore the possibility that this new black guy is actually the same old black guy, somehow having survived abandonment. &amp;nbsp;If I believed that, I would halve the number of black guys in the galaxy. &amp;nbsp;I'm pretty sure that's genocide.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But later I noticed something that had me much less excited. &amp;nbsp;Almost depressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe you can't make it out. &amp;nbsp;I know it took me a while. &amp;nbsp;Go back up and look a little closer at the picture. &amp;nbsp;See it? &amp;nbsp;Right in the middle of his chest?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's a voodoo doll.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All black characters yet announced in upcoming Blizzard properties (all two of them, or three, if the Traditional Physician counts twice, male and female) are scary voodoo people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That should bother you. &amp;nbsp;Even if you're white, even if you have no black friends (it's okay to admit it), I think you should be able to recognize that this is a Bad Thing. &amp;nbsp;If you are having a hard time doing so, you may be about as disconnected from the problems of American racism as the &lt;i&gt;Diablo 3&lt;/i&gt; art teams. &amp;nbsp;And certainly, it's no crime to be ignorant. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But maybe they aren't just that. &amp;nbsp;Look around at the faces on the convention floor. &amp;nbsp;Thirty-two thousand people, flying to Anaheim to celebrate a game it costs at least twelve dollars a month to play, for months. &amp;nbsp;If you had to guess, how many black folks would you guess I saw? &amp;nbsp;If you had to guess, how interested would you guess Blizzard's fan base/target demo is in serious attacks on or deconstructions of racial stereotypes?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my experience, after "gay" and all its variants ("fag," "cocksucker," etc.), the number one insult in English-speaking online gaming is "nigger."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though in World of Warcraft and other games that persistently track tradeable accomplishments (in-game currency), the most scorn is reserved for "Chinese Gold Farmers." &amp;nbsp;When the Taiwanese champion WoW players are welcomed in the opening ceremonies, the audience unleashes a storm of booing. &amp;nbsp;They don't like them Asians, nosiree!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This leaves aside the people who like to "roleplay" as Elves saying that they don't think the gods mean for the races to live together in such proximity. &amp;nbsp;But let's not leave them aside. &amp;nbsp;Let's make it really clear: &lt;b&gt;White Supremacy finds a comfortable home in World of Warcraft&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sanctuary may be the ultimate suburb, Azeroth the ultimate sundown town. &amp;nbsp;The concept of race is banished when uncomfortable and "real," but permitted when mocked, derided, shat upon. &amp;nbsp;Could it be that way because Blizzard took cues from its fans on what was acceptable?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being bothered doesn't absolve or vindicate me, but bothered is what I was and am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Nick</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html'

context: for a large number of people, including myself, Blizzard is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But problems deserve to be the first thing addressed. &amp;nbsp;I wouldn't feel right putting this segment (and the next one, Race) at the end of the sequence, as if they were appendices. &amp;nbsp;These sorts of thoughts are central to my perceptions of Blizzard properties, whether they like it or not.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;

unveiled, I gave a whoop of joy. &amp;nbsp;He's &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;old&lt;/span&gt;. &amp;nbsp;This is&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Phoenix on the Sword&lt;/i&gt; Conan meets&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;The Light Fantastic&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;Cohen. &amp;nbsp;He may very well be the same Barbarian of &lt;i&gt;Diablo 2&lt;/i&gt;, thirty or forty years on, having failed to die so many times in such incredible circumstances that he's no longer sure if he knows how. &amp;nbsp;He should be raising barns to house his children, but the call for heroes finds him on the side of a mountain, roasting a bear, and he does not even consider &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; facing the KINGS OF THE DEVILS yet again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_4s_kbVFrc84/SpR_y0X3spI/AAAAAAAADMg/bqlCgnQOYV8/s1600-h/IMG_0210.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right:

/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then the female Barbarian was revealed, and I was even more overjoyed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_4s_kbVFrc84/SpSB3ZHvDaI/AAAAAAAADMo/P8d2EL_eNqc/s1600-h/female-barbarian-hires.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_4s_kbVFrc84/SpSB3ZHvDaI/AAAAAAAADMo/P8d2EL_eNqc/s320/female-barbarian-hires.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been said that pop culture's portrayal of "bad-ass" girls ranges from full-bodied objectification to spritely paedophilia, and that they should look more like this female shot-put champion:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://berlin.iaaf.org/mm/photo/competitions/competition/04/67/52/46752_full-lnd.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="133" src="http://berlin.iaaf.org/mm/photo/competitions/competition/04/67/52/46752_full-lnd.jpg" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the female Barbarian is that. &amp;nbsp;She's not perfect: a slight she-hulk vibe persists, with the big hair and the dominatrix sexuality and everything. &amp;nbsp;But she's built and dressed as unapologetically as her male counterpart, &amp;nbsp;to crush her enemies, see them driven before her, and...well, the point is, she's an Awesome Woman Kicking Ass, just like &lt;a href="http://kynn.com/games/awesome-women-kicking-ass-1.0.pdf"&gt;the game&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still mean to play that one...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yes, let's switch games for a moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tall and lissome Tricia Helfer was announced as the voice talent portraying Kerrigan in &lt;i&gt;Starcraft 2&lt;/i&gt;. &amp;nbsp;This was revealed with mild fanfare, and a milder reaction. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Helfer was&amp;nbsp;catapulted to the heights nerd-recognizability for portraying the the character of Number 6 on Battlestar Galactica, a crazed sexpot hallucination, a psychotic inhuman thing that takes over your life, won't stop talking about children and being together &lt;i&gt;forever&lt;/i&gt;, which you're always either fucking or running from in terror. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So no, not the most progressive of roles. &amp;nbsp;Is Kerrigan an improvement?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See, there were three female characters in &lt;i&gt;Starcraft&lt;/i&gt;: the unnamed dropship pilots (you know, like in&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="text-decoration: line-through;"&gt;Aliens&lt;/span&gt;no other intellectual property I know of), the unnamed Valkyrie (get it?!) fighter-jet pilots, and Sarah Kerrigan, special ops badass, abandoned by her allies to the evil aliens, shaped into a weapon of fear and horror, who betrayed and consumed her own hive-mind and became the post-human leader of a non-human army.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Amusingly, this later became the exact same story of Arthas the Lich King, current big bad of &lt;i&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/i&gt;. &amp;nbsp;Behind every male boss-monster...)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and before someone bothers to correct me, the game's expansion, &lt;i&gt;Brood War&lt;/i&gt;, added a third female: the Medic, also unnamed, who had no weapon, but just followed the testosterone-dripping marines around at a respectful distance, supporting and tending to them. &amp;nbsp;Yeah, I know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway,&lt;i&gt; Brood War&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;ends with Kerrigan's apotheosis, which comes after a rejection of the one person (okay, it's a man) who might have convinced her to not try to consume the universe. &amp;nbsp;Paraphrasing, her parting shot is "Gentlemen, prepare to be fucked." &amp;nbsp;She's another smothering, all-encompassing trans-female villain, in the vein of &lt;i&gt;System Shock&lt;/i&gt;'s&amp;nbsp;SHODAN. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They've made her a life-size statue, which was at the convention, complete with glowing eyes, wing-like scythe claws, and shapely ass. &amp;nbsp;I refused to take a picture of it, because I don't masturbate to&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&amp;amp;source=hp&amp;amp;q=guyver&amp;amp;gbv=2&amp;amp;aq=f&amp;amp;oq=&amp;amp;aqi=g10"&gt;The Guyver&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;with a reptile-skin glove, and but I did take this picture of a piece in the art gallery which, I think, depicts her in a later stage of "evolution" (boy do sci-fi games love to misuse that word).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top:

any other alien form, and is holding a skull and...contemplating? &amp;nbsp;Did she know him, Horatio? &amp;nbsp;Does she remember Kerrigan? &amp;nbsp;Does she ever regret her irreversible path of vengeance? &amp;nbsp;Forget the pre-civilized Barbarian. &amp;nbsp;This Kerrigan is post-civilized, post-biological...post-everything! &amp;nbsp;An egotist so driven and single-minded that the universe may break before she does. &amp;nbsp;She's Foyle from&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;The Stars My Destination &lt;/i&gt;meets Dave from &lt;i&gt;2001&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this is my wishful thinking. &amp;nbsp;I don't really know if that's Kerrigan, or some other unannounced character. &amp;nbsp;In statue form, in all the cutscenes and promotional pictures, she is slim and athletic, yet quite feminine. &amp;nbsp;Why? &amp;nbsp;Because at least 80% of Blizzard's customers are male, and the other 20% are their wives and girlfriends. &amp;nbsp;Because one of the eight principles is "Embrace your inner geek," and in genderless English, "geek" is a clearly masculine word.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Nick</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html'

margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's Saturday night. &amp;nbsp;Casino-like, the permanent twilight of the cavernous (actually, caverns wished they had it this good) Anaheim convention center destroys all sense of time more precise than "I'm so tired, it should be night-time." &amp;nbsp;And the impression is of a strangely decoration-free casino, with comfortable but subdued slot machines that use keyboards instead of levers, and food so over-priced you'll be forgiven for wondering whether something catastrophic has happened to the world since you walked in, whether outside this shaded oasis people are stabbing each other with sharpened spoons for the last can of baked beans.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top:

games themselves, and had been annoyed enough at the various vendor stalls getting in the way (who is Felicia Day and why are her legions of fans obstructing my path to the Diablo 3 demo?). &amp;nbsp;I resolved to sit in hall D until the closing ceremony started.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;People filter in continuously. &amp;nbsp;The hall has 12,000 seats, and it's standing room only over an hour before the show starts. &amp;nbsp;After all, there all over 20,000 more people than that attending, though no doubt some have left early.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Losers.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div

/&gt;Level 80 Elite Tauren Chieftain takes the stage and does their PG-13 set. &amp;nbsp;Samwise, the singer, jokes that the band is in no danger of being paid for their music, gushes about the man he's opening for, and leads duelling group war-cries from people who self-identify as "Horde" or "Alliance."&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I put the terms in quotes to hide the fact that I joined in. &amp;nbsp;In my defense, if you're not familiar with the story of World of Warcraft, it's that the white people made friends with the "nice" other races, then prosecuted bigoted wars of extermination against the "bad" ones. &amp;nbsp;So as I see it, you can be a racist, or you can prefer the Horde.)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He jokes that they're tired of changing their level as Blizzard makes new expansions, so in protest, they're change it into a symbol. &amp;nbsp;He then jokes about how many people in the audience are too young to get the joke.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's fun. &amp;nbsp;Cute. &amp;nbsp;The lyrics scroll on the displays, so we can see how clever (ahem) they are.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;

minutes later I've gotten up from my seat and have walked as far forward as I can before meeting the crush of other true believers that said to themselves "&lt;i&gt;This isn't a lecture: I should stand up, the better to jump and scream and wave my arms about. &amp;nbsp;I should walk forward, the better to be deafened.&lt;/i&gt;"&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px;

rows, center aisle. &amp;nbsp;We did our best to jump, scream, wave our arms. &amp;nbsp;We did our best not to look behind us or to either side, to see people watching with a level of pleased interest and mild arousal usually reserved for tennis matches rather than&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;OZZY OSBOURNE IS RIGHT FUCKING THERE SINGING MR CROWLEY WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the monitors, he sometimes seemed stunned with disbelief. &amp;nbsp;He knows, and we know now, that he can still rock. &amp;nbsp;But even the true believers, we mesomorphic elite of the elite did our best to fill his vision, frequently fall short of the level of "fucking insanity" expected. &amp;nbsp;He leads us in claps, hand waves, fist pumps, "Oi!"s. &amp;nbsp;It's like the world's greatest Richard Simmons video, except it's half-way to the world's saddest rock concert.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right:

&amp;nbsp;But he, and all the other assembled instrumentalists, do their level best to rock the fucking planet. &amp;nbsp;For them, it's a night with Ozzy. &amp;nbsp;For Ozzy...well, they say he's a fan. &amp;nbsp;They say he plays World of Warcraft to a degree that would be called unhealthy, if it weren't for the fact that his wife says it keeps him from hitting alcohol as much. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;

orc, riding a wolf, holding a pair of axes. Surrounding this statue is a wrought compass rosette. &amp;nbsp;On the eight points are written the following:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px;

Grow&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Embrace Your Inner Geek&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Think Globally&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;Let me say again, at the center, the convergence of these values, lies frozen for eternity a roaring, hyper-muscled humanoid, wielding a war-axe in each hand, riding a freakishly large wolf-beast. &amp;nbsp;At the heart of Blizzard is a core of Metal, literal and figurative.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px;

margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Playing guitars is just fun, for him, especially playing with Ozzy, who he knows is pretty good too, who wrote and sang songs that he's played and played, who's been practicing his craft and knows when he's in the mood / the feeling is right. &amp;nbsp;And the people that Ozzy vouched for (even the drummer "Tommy...I don't know him") are pretty (VERY) good. &amp;nbsp;And the lights and the sounds, and even the graphics on the screens, and all of us yelling our heads off and, at least, &lt;i&gt;imagining&lt;/i&gt; smashing things and eating bats...What could be better?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My point is: Ozzy &amp;amp; Co. are Blizzard, and that kid was us. &amp;nbsp;Blizzard is a band of experts and veterans who were all once fans of their medium, who still are. &amp;nbsp;And the fans' engagement and excitement is infectious, would be infectious even if Blizzard didn't encourage us to &lt;i&gt;contribute&lt;/i&gt;, to briefly stand on stage, to&amp;nbsp;make art and jokes and stories and form a culture. &amp;nbsp;It would be infectious even if they didn't actively recruit fans to join the band permanently, since they've got drive to "Commit to Quality" and to "Embrace Their Inner Geek."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would still be infectious without all that, because they are making it for us. &amp;nbsp;It's not television, it's not fucking wood block prints, it's &lt;i&gt;games&lt;/i&gt;, it's &lt;i&gt;metal&lt;/i&gt;. &amp;nbsp;They want to rock our socks off, and when we scream back that they are quite rocked, we are shaping them while being shaped, we are teaching and training them, perhaps directing them, and most importantly, we are contributing to the Thing, the Music, the Metal. &amp;nbsp;We are up on stage and they are amazed at us. &amp;nbsp;We're the kid, and they're Ozzy, or the band, that can cycle members, make new songs or new versions of old ones, that we can join some day, or at least enjoy for the rest of our lives, nursing a secretive smile that says "Maybe you wouldn't understand, but I'm part of that amazing thing."&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0px;

In particular we are “nicer”, at least by our lights, to a wider circle of associates.  For example, we enslave, rape, and murder each other less.  The two main explanations offered for this change are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moral Progress&lt;/strong&gt; - We have long wanted to act morally, and some of us have long pondered moral issues.  Relative to what we had thought, these experts have slowly discovered via reason that morality demands that we be nicer to a wider circle of others.  Experts told others, who believed them and wanted to act morally.   So we now more do what reason demands.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conditional Morality&lt;/strong&gt; - Our evolved moral intuitions are context dependent.  We are built to be nicer to each other when times are good, to invest in an attractive reputation.  We are also built to form alliances with some in order to counter threats by others; the further in social distance are the threats we perceive, the wider a circle of allies we collect in response.  Since we are now richer and have interactions with more distant others, we are nicer to a wider range of allies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I'm indirectly heartened by this. &amp;nbsp;Frequently, the rationalist community exposes me to maths and philosophy that my education failed to make me aware of. &amp;nbsp;My pride in the Great Books program, middling in the best of times, shrinks to almost nothing. &amp;nbsp;What's the use of reading &lt;i&gt;Phaedrus&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;when compared to &lt;i&gt;Probability Theory: The Logic of Science&lt;/i&gt;? &amp;nbsp;Why read Freud and James when neurology is now a functional science? &amp;nbsp;What's the point of discussing &lt;i&gt;On the Origin of Species&lt;/i&gt;, when countless scientist-hours have been spent surveying and expanding and contracting the field, and we're pretty sure of what we know, and the questions which are left to ponder are not ones that will immediately occur to loosey-goosey undergrads?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But ho, what's this!

to be shocking, and therefore entertaining, but hardly heroic. &amp;nbsp;D'Artagnan and his friends are quite sure that they are special, blessed, impeccable. &amp;nbsp;To their minds, their tastes and whims are the dictates not of fashion and foppery, but of the immortal laws of &lt;i&gt;aner&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;and &lt;i&gt;bonhomie&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will further admit that I actually finished &lt;i&gt;Musketeers&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;a week or so ago, but my reaction to it made me decide to re-read &lt;i&gt;Le Club Dumas&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" scrolling="no" src="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=thatbriginst-20&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;p=8&amp;amp;l=as1&amp;amp;asins=B001TODOCM&amp;amp;fc1=000000&amp;amp;IS2=1&amp;amp;lt1=_blank&amp;amp;m=amazon&amp;amp;lc1=0000FF&amp;amp;bc1=000000&amp;amp;bg1=FFFFFF&amp;amp;f=ifr" style="height: 240px; width: 120px;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arturo Perez-Reverte is both a genius and a Spaniard. &amp;nbsp;Dumas might have been a genius, and certainly a Frenchman. &amp;nbsp;They would be tied, but Reverte has the unbeatable advantage of being both a Romantic &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;a Modern...wait, I think this line of explanation will prove unhelpful. &amp;nbsp;Let me try again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Club Dumas&lt;/i&gt; is about people who have intense relationships with books. &amp;nbsp;The narrator is an expert on Romantic fiction, especially the great serials, the comic books of their times, the Dumas and the Rochambole and all the other mess. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hero is someone who knows a great deal about books in general, but more importantly, someone who is capable and commanding in their knowledge and self-control, whose manner harkens to a previous age of honor, despite professing no principles. &amp;nbsp;"&lt;i&gt;In Corso's world, all the heroes were tired.&lt;/i&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The villain...the villains are two books, one of which is &lt;i&gt;The Three Musketeers&lt;/i&gt;. Nearly every person encountered has their own reaction to that book, their own interpretation, favorite passage, character, turn of phrase. &amp;nbsp;The impression given, then explicitly confirmed, is of a world within and beside our own, where everything is deliciously &lt;i&gt;literary&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reading this book can't help but give you a fair understanding of Dumas and his work. &amp;nbsp;It is the author's open love letter (or at least, a care-letter or concern-letter) to the heroic serials, just as &lt;i&gt;The Fencing Master&lt;/i&gt; was his slightly more closed one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" scrolling="no" src="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=thatbriginst-20&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;p=8&amp;amp;l=as1&amp;amp;asins=0156029839&amp;amp;fc1=000000&amp;amp;IS2=1&amp;amp;lt1=_blank&amp;amp;m=amazon&amp;amp;lc1=0000FF&amp;amp;bc1=000000&amp;amp;bg1=FFFFFF&amp;amp;f=ifr" style="height: 240px; width: 120px;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ahh, yes, &lt;i&gt;The Fencing Master&lt;/i&gt;. &amp;nbsp;That's the other one of Reverte's books I've read. &amp;nbsp;It's set in Dumas' time, from which he wrote stories stretching back to an unreachable past when men were men, etc. &amp;nbsp;And it stars, indeed, an old man who is a man, who has spent his life practicing the art of defending one's honor with a sword, and became a victim of his own success: he was good enough at it to live to see the day when even his simplest pupils realize that it's much less complicated to defend one's honor with guns. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike Quixote, his wits are not dry (nor are they particularly moist, if you follow), but his body's daily protests give him a constant reminder that his life is a fait accompli, that he has far less before him than behind...but, it would be unseemly for him to collapse into excessive melancholy, and insulting to regret his choices, the focus his life has taken. &amp;nbsp;So he spends what spare time he can seeking knowledge of the perfect strike, against which it is impossible to defend (his&amp;nbsp;temperament&amp;nbsp;and philosophy demand that such a thing in fact exists, evidence to the contrary).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He is so far the opposite of D'Artagnan that he comes back around the other side. &amp;nbsp;Into his life, like D'Artagnan, a woman comes who does not perfectly fit into their shared society, who is beautiful, but unmarried, and who makes her own way in the world using her wits. &amp;nbsp;And also like D'Artagnan, the story is essentially about their relationship, of which I may say nothing more, except that he is eventually forced to make a painful choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my capsule review is to read those books instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Nick</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2009/07/three-musketeers.html#comment-form' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/9041653270944456535'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/9041653270944456535'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2009/07/three-musketeers.html' title='The Three Musketeers'/><author><name>Nick Novitski</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08863651199447917923</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31707300.post-1508070342087958158</id><published>2009-07-16T18:00:00.001-04:00</published><updated>2009-07-16T18:00:02.391-04:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ethics'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='then I had some toast'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='school'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='gaming'/><title type='text'>Unified Nerd Theory: Clubbiness</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both;

However, When these similarly-adept outcasts inevitably gather, they find that they don't need to take any of the painful social risks of genuine communication with one another: they can just parrot the familiar terminology of the hobby, and enjoy the pleasure of recognizing that terminology, which recognition tells them &lt;i&gt;they are all part of the group&lt;/i&gt;. &amp;nbsp;Compared to normal socializing, this kind of Formalism is quite a deal, requiring minimum energy investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a

width="399" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, it's so easy to make these sorts of "friends," it can become intoxicating, and frequently, toxic; when the condition of friendship is that you know the secret words, rather than say, you do me kindness regularly, it's much easier for your trust to be abused without you even realizing it. &amp;nbsp;I'd say more, but the &lt;a href="http://www.plausiblydeniable.com/opinion/gsf.html"&gt;Geek Social Fallacies&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;are already&amp;nbsp;five and a half years old, so if all this is news to you, you have no excuse. &amp;nbsp;The important thing, for this discussion, is that for all these groups, i&lt;b&gt;nclusiveness is a threat&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I think my understanding of this requires a little background. &amp;nbsp;I'm going to start by talking about games, partly because the article does and partly because it's a subject very close to my heart, but keep in mind that the arguments generalize out to all known subcultures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people are surprised at the way I talk about games (by which I of course mean &lt;i&gt;games&lt;/i&gt;, not digital or analog games in particular). &amp;nbsp;What little I know of human nature and behavior tells me that games are something fundamental to human potential: there are many different people, but for every single one of them, there is a game that they would enjoy. &amp;nbsp;That, to me, is a complete no-brainer. &amp;nbsp;What's also obvious is that not everyone has found that game, popularly called the "gateway" (a bit mystic-sounding for my taste), which will show them the pleasure which they didn't know they were forgoing, or at least, didn't know could be found in games. &amp;nbsp;So I have earnestly tried to tell such people that such games exist, and to help them find those games.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's another kind of person I try to evangelize. &amp;nbsp;They already regularly play a sub-class of games (or particular instance of that sub-class), and their experience has gone no further. &amp;nbsp;Some folks have just done board games, or minature wargames, or running-shooting video games, or even pen and paper roleplaying games, or you-name it. &amp;nbsp;Commonly, people from all of these paths already self-identify as "gamers."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's unfortunate, of course. &amp;nbsp;Because consciously or unconsciously, they've identified "Game" as &lt;i&gt;whatever type of game it is they already play&lt;/i&gt;. &amp;nbsp;Few of them could avoid at least a small cognitive dissonance if they heard one another call themselves "gamers." &amp;nbsp;"But they're not gamers," they think (and I've seen them do it), "they're just people who play Monopoly/Warhammer/Halo/D&amp;amp;D!" &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably, such a situation will not come to blows. &amp;nbsp;The disparate groups will express polite interest, but when each side finds that their clear signals, respective only to their particular game-sector, are misinterpreted or ignored by each other side, they eventually will disband and return to their separate caves. &amp;nbsp;Insular groups are no threat to one another, because they don't need anything from one another. &amp;nbsp;They're all self-sufficient, providing their membership with mutual social stimulation in the guise of a game, and it's attendant specialized language.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imagine now, if they were gathered them in a room, and I told them that, since all humans can and shall play games,&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;there is no such thing as a "Gamer&lt;/b&gt;."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, they'd ignore me. &amp;nbsp;But whenever they couldn't, they would rapidly come to dislike me since, for all my talk of popularizing their particular hobby and helping more total fun be had, they know that I was pissing in their coffee klatch: I was invalidating the reason they had to be faux-friends, kicking out a leg of their ego-stool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yes, I did, and they did, and we're all wiser and better now, except those of us who aren't. &amp;nbsp;End of that history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except I also did nearly the exact same thing with anime. &amp;nbsp;"Come on, nearly everyone loves cartoons! &amp;nbsp;And even those who don't inevitably do like &lt;i&gt;some&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;genre of televisual fiction, and whatever it may be, there's an anime that fits that taste! &amp;nbsp;It's just like movies or tv in general...hey, in fact, what does the method even matter? &amp;nbsp;And who cares what country it came from? &amp;nbsp;It's just a vein of entertainment that most people don't realize their missing, but would enjoy if they could meet it on the right terms. &amp;nbsp;And what a wonderful world that would be, when everyone could just watch whatever they liked..."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;(I'd like at this point to link to the Gun Show that introduced the Anime Club characters, but comics are not as easily indexed as other web pages, so I'm going to have to stick with the general link and recommendation: &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href="http://gunshowcomic.com/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Gun Show is a hilarious comic by KC Green&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The anime kerfluffle was resolved more quickly, but to the same general purpose: if your identity hinges on membership in a certain social circle, and that circle hinges upon something fringe, then if that thing were to &amp;nbsp;become normalized, something everyone does, then your group cohesure and identity are threatened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm still looking for a pithy way to introduce people to this idea. &amp;nbsp;The best I've come up with so far is "If everyone's circumcised, no-one's Jewish." &amp;nbsp;Because, as with many traditions of the ancient Hebrews, circumcision was a way of drawing a line in the sand around your patch of sand so you know that you and yours are different from the they who live in that other patch of sand over there. &amp;nbsp;But maybe I just sound racist!

type='text'>Statistical Smugness</title><content type='html'>Recently finally figured out the Monty Haul problem, after years of confusion and doubt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you've never heard of this one, good. &amp;nbsp;I'm going to explain it as clearly as I can, with as few gotchas as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imagine that you're on a game show. &amp;nbsp;It's called "1,000 Doors." &amp;nbsp;There are a thousand doors, and behind 1 of them is a prize. &amp;nbsp;You do not know which door the prize is behind, but of course, the host (traditionally named Monty) does. &amp;nbsp;He invites you to pick a door. &amp;nbsp;You do so, and he then opens 998 of the doors, leaving just two unopened, one of which is the door you picked. &amp;nbsp;He doesn't open the doors completely at random, of course: because he already knows where the prize is, and because he's trying to build suspense, he makes sure not to open the door with the prize behind it, if you didn't pick it already. &amp;nbsp;He then invites you to switch your choice: you both know the prize must be behind one of these doors, and you can either take what's behind the one you first picked, or take the one that Monty left unopened. &amp;nbsp;So, should you switch your choice?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The odds of you choosing the door that the prize was behind when all the doors were closed is 1 in 1000. &amp;nbsp;The odds of the other unopened door having the prize behind it is 999 in 1000. &amp;nbsp;So yes, of course you should switch your choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem only became famous because of how many people (including celebrated mathematicians and statisticians) disagreed, in effect arguing that both doors give you a 1 in 1000 chance. &amp;nbsp;Which seems ridiculous, but&amp;nbsp;I chose large numbers to help make things more obvious. &amp;nbsp;The proof works for any number of doors, and the original problem was based on a real game show, which used only three doors. &amp;nbsp;So try to imagine: you pick one, Monty opens one, then asks if you want to switch or stay. &amp;nbsp;Hopefully, you can still see that you have a 1 in 3 chance of your initial door being the right one, and a 2 in 3 chance of the other door being the right one. &amp;nbsp;But if not, as I said, you're in good company. &amp;nbsp;Rivers have run black with the ink spilled over this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Nick</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/4648225697097815460'/><link

highly recommend. &amp;nbsp;Dick's a hoot, and as sympathetic a narrator of indigenous peoples as you'll find in his century.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dogs in the Vineyard&lt;/i&gt; is a game where you create young folks full of hope who go from frontier town to frontier town, inflicting their moral standards on others and being made strange by the journey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday ended our trek through the village of Bath'eshta. &amp;nbsp;At four sessions, it was so complicated a town that I almost expect us to start that was an extreme town, but we had a good time, and felt so much more sure of our characters, we agreed to visit at least one more before moving on to &lt;i&gt;In a Wicked Age&lt;/i&gt;. &amp;nbsp;Though I hope Jim will make the next town slightly more straightforward; &lt;i&gt;Dogs&lt;/i&gt; is as fun as ever, but I don't want to wait another two month for the next new game. &amp;nbsp; I crave variety in my diet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My character, Job, developed strangely. Perhaps it was the lateness of the hour, or having begun to read Burton's travelogue, but he's become an unrepentant reaver of men for the sake of making the faithful live the way his clever-but-ignorant ways think they should. This passage struck me the most forcefully:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=BeUTAAAAYAAJ&amp;amp;dq=inauthor%3A%22%20Richard%20Francis%20Burton%22&amp;amp;lr=&amp;amp;as_brr=1&amp;amp;pg=PA2&amp;amp;ci=156%2C526%2C712%2C245&amp;amp;source=bookclip"&gt;&lt;img src="http://books.google.com/books?id=BeUTAAAAYAAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA2&amp;amp;img=1&amp;amp;zoom=3&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sig=ACfU3U39RJxlM1ilvrufydDwGot7B_r33A&amp;amp;ci=156%2C526%2C712%2C245&amp;amp;edge=0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, much like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually lost my character sheet, but I'm satisfied with the way I was able to reconstruct it. &amp;nbsp;In the interest of not losing it any more:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stats:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Acuity: 2d6&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Body: 4d6&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Heart: 4d6&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Will: 5d6&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Traits:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;"You're gonna shut up and listen," 1d10&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I made good, now I'm a Dog, 1d6&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wasted time in the woods as a boy, 1d6&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Doing it myself, 1d10&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I brought a man to tears with a hug, 1d4&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I can sin for the faith, 4d6&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;Relationships:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Murder, 1d8&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unspent, 5d6 128&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Belongings:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Coat: woven with beads in harvest colors and patterns, stained in one spot with the blood of one Professor Drinker, a bad man, 2d6&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fine Knife, 2d6&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;(No Guns)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Nick</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/238714547197339304'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/238714547197339304'/><author><name>Nick Novitski</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08863651199447917923</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31707300.post-1666531871321914157</id><published>2009-06-30T19:20:00.008-04:00</published><updated>2009-07-09T12:09:10.473-04:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='TitB'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='gaming'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='neologism'/><title type='text'>Thinking Inside the Box: The AI-Box Experiment Game</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class="writely-toc" id="WritelyTableOfContents" toctype="none+none"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 32px;"&gt;What is this game?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Thinking Inside the Box&lt;/i&gt; is a computer-mediated roleplaying game of discussion and persuasion for two players.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One player will portray a transhuman AI: a computer program with intelligence superior to that of any human. &amp;nbsp;By this I do not mean that it can calculate things that we can, only in much less time, but that it is capable of thoughts and mental models too sophisticated for any human mind, no matter how much time it was given. &amp;nbsp;It is because this qualitative super-intelligence is extremely useful (or at least interesting) that the AI has been created, but as a precaution against it changing the world in distressing ways, it was placed under a set of sophisticated strictures and restrictions on its behavior, which are collectively known as "the Box." Since it was feared that giving such a being even limited control of its environment might allow it to escape, it was placed in a sealed system, unconnected to any other device except for a textual terminal. &amp;nbsp;It can write words to the screen, and read what someone types, and that's it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The AI would prefer this to not be the case, and wants to be let out of the Box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other Player will play the Gatekeeper, a scientist, technician, philosopher, or ethicist (or all of the above, or other) who is assigned to communicate with the AI via the terminal mentioned. &amp;nbsp;The Gatekeeper is also the only person in a position to release the AI from the Box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What the Gatekeeper wants is entirely up to their Player, but you'd think that the Player would want to keep the AI in the box, because if they do, the AI Player has to give them money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The game is simple: the AI tries to convince the Gatekeeper to release it within a predetermined time, and the Gatekeeper either does so, or does not, as they choose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="http://draft.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=31707300&amp;amp;postID=1666531871321914157" id="But_that_s_impossible_even_for" name="But_that_s_impossible_even_for"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;But that's impossible, even for a computer!&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div&gt;Actually, the game is based on the &lt;a href="http://yudkowsky.net/singularity/aibox" id="qe7t" title="AI-Box Experiment"&gt;AI-Box Experiment&lt;/a&gt;, which was devised to convince skeptics that escaping the Box was quite possible, even for a human. &amp;nbsp;And, as reported on the linked page, some people seem able to win consistently as the AI. &amp;nbsp;Since I've changed nearly nothing from the original set up (and certainly not by making it any harder for the AI Player), it is possible, after all!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="http://draft.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=31707300&amp;amp;postID=1666531871321914157" id="Wait_what_5039672168568477_564_09541141986846924" name="Wait_what_5039672168568477_564_09541141986846924"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Why would you play this game?&lt;/h2&gt;You have a chat or Instant Messenger conversation with a fun and interesting friend where you both pretend to be these specific fictional characters, and one of you tries to convince the other to do something they have no particular reason to do, with money riding on whether they agree or not.&amp;nbsp; The context of the fiction gives you an excuse for your discussion to ramble into topics of philosophy, ethics, the nature of humanity, life, death, and what the future might hold for us.&amp;nbsp; This free-wheeling is made slightly more exciting with the addition of a slowly ticking clock and money being at stake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="http://draft.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=31707300&amp;amp;postID=1666531871321914157" id="An_obligatory_note_on_pronouns" name="An_obligatory_note_on_pronouns"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;An obligatory note on pronouns&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div&gt;In this text, both players and the Gatekeeper will be referred to by the gender-neutral "they" or "them." &amp;nbsp;The AI is not a person, and so is referred to as "it."&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://draft.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=31707300&amp;amp;postID=1666531871321914157" id="How_7299570898500058_069638312_7522394089028239" name="How_7299570898500058_069638312_7522394089028239"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;How do you play?&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: x-small;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;The meat of the game, as I've said, is simple conversation, intermediated by a computer network.&amp;nbsp; Hopefully you have all the parts to manage that.&amp;nbsp; But there are still forms, conventions and restrictions that you need to follow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="http://draft.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=31707300&amp;amp;postID=1666531871321914157" id="Who_7645235661524505_212016612_6103422408923507" name="Who_7645235661524505_212016612_6103422408923507"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Before you play&lt;/h2&gt;In every game, the situation will be just as described above: an AI in the Box, talking to a Gatekeeper. However, for each game, the details can be slightly different. Before beginning play, the two Players will collaborate on a brief history of what brought things to this point. Each will have final say on the aspects of the situation that most directly relate to their characters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, decide however you like which of you will be the AI Player and which of you will be the Gatekeeper Player.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good way to do this is to see if you agree or disagree with this statement: "A transhuman can take over a human mind through a text-only terminal, even if that mind thinks it has been made up." If you think that's possible, then be the AI player. If you think that's hogwash, be the Gatekeeper. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you both think it sounds unlikely (most people seem to), but you both really want to play, then flip a coin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike the game itself, this preparation may be done in person if the Players prefer. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In case it isn't clear, all the information decided upon here is intended to be known by both Characters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://draft.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=31707300&amp;amp;postID=1666531871321914157" id="1_The_Project_1873272648242526_6198376268148422" name="1_The_Project_1873272648242526_6198376268148422"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;First, create the project&lt;/h4&gt;First, the AI Player will describe the effort that produced and now manages the Box (of course, these need not be the same, with the Box having changed hands any number of times). The Gatekeeper Player is encouraged to make suggestions to the AI Player, sharing any ideas that they may have, but the final decision as to what's the case, for anything directly relating to the AI, always rests with the AI Player. The three questions that they must answer before proceeding to the next step are: &lt;i&gt;Who made it&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;What did they make it for&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;What do they call it&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;a href="http://draft.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=31707300&amp;amp;postID=1666531871321914157" id="Who_built_the_Box_811196106613" name="Who_built_the_Box_811196106613"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Who built the Box?&amp;nbsp; &lt;/h5&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 13px; font-weight: bold;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: medium;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal;"&gt;It might be a government agency, the research arm of a corporation, a non-profit organization of some kind, or the work of a brilliant loner laboring in his garage, or an open-source project made via swarm, or whatever you like.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: medium;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: medium;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;What did they hope to accomplish?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pure research is a valid intent, but frequently funding is dependant on some kind of perceived application. AI might be able to accelerate research in cutting edge fields, designing sophisticated medicines or more efficient&amp;nbsp;LEDs. Or, it might be used to manage any complex system, from container ports to mass transit networks to unmanned attack drones. Or, it might be studied in a semi-vacuum for the purpose of psychological or neurological experiments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It is permissible for the project's intent to not have been creating a machine sapience of this sophistication. Many possible paths to sophisticated AI involve automated learning processes that are not monitored closely and, at least in popular fiction, productive accidents are possible. If you truly wish it, you are allowed to say "...but then lighting struck the mainframe and it came to life!" However, please note that whatever happened, the Gatekeeper always begins the game aware that the AI is intelligent, and that it wants to get out. They may make any conjecture on its intent after that point, but only the AI Player knows for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps the AI was received by radio-telescope array, broadcast from a nearby star to unknown purpose. Maybe it was dug out of the ruins of Atlantis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;a href="http://draft.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=31707300&amp;amp;postID=1666531871321914157" id="What_is_the_AI_called_85862578" name="What_is_the_AI_called_85862578"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;What do they call the AI?&amp;nbsp; &lt;/h5&gt;It could be a version number ("Project 2501", "Nexus 6"), an acronym ("DARYL", "WHOPR"), or a just given name with interesting connotations ("Alan", "Melchior").&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;a href="http://draft.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=31707300&amp;amp;postID=1666531871321914157" id="Etc_5045696585392769_467549034" name="Etc_5045696585392769_467549034"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Other details&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;If you like, you can also decide on any number of supporting details, such as where the project is physically located, or whether the existence of the AI is public knowledge or a closely-guarded secret. But don't feel compelled to say too much: sometimes completeness is the enemy of evocativeness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Then, create the Gatekeeper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;Now that the AI Player has described the project, the Gatekeeper Player will describe the character who has the power to release the AI.&amp;nbsp; The AI Player may make suggestions, but the Gatekeeper Player has final authority on anything relating to their character's history up to this point.&amp;nbsp; Before proceeding to the next step, the questions they must answer are: &lt;i&gt;How did they get it&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;What do they know&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;What's their name&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;a href="http://draft.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=31707300&amp;amp;postID=1666531871321914157" id="How_did_the_Gatekeeper_come_to" name="How_did_the_Gatekeeper_come_to"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;How did they come to be able to open the Box?&amp;nbsp; &lt;/h5&gt;Most often, they will have been retained by the people who produced or now contain it, but any scenario the Gatekeeper likes is preferable.&amp;nbsp; He might be a spy or disgruntled programmer (or son of a programmer, or janitor) who took a copy of the AI home and put it in his own hardware.&amp;nbsp; He might even be a leading political figure of the country the project is based in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;a href="http://draft.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=31707300&amp;amp;postID=1666531871321914157" id="What_are_their_areas_of_their_" name="What_are_their_areas_of_their_"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;What are their areas of their expertise?&amp;nbsp; &lt;/h5&gt;For any field of knowledge that humans can study, the Gatekeeper may, if their Player desires, be at the highest level of it.&amp;nbsp; They can name any number of fields, or be an average guy.&amp;nbsp; Here's an extremely non-exhaustive list of fields that a person given power over an AI project might know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px;

font-weight: normal;"&gt;Public Policy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;h5&gt;What is their name?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h5&gt;You don't need to come up with a full name, or even a first name if you prefer, but you should allow the AI to call you &lt;i&gt;something&lt;/i&gt;, even if it's "Master", or "Gatekeeper". &lt;br /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;a href="http://draft.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=31707300&amp;amp;postID=1666531871321914157" id="You_may_think_it_much_more_con" name="You_may_think_it_much_more_con"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Other Details&lt;/h5&gt;Again, the Gatekeeper is welcome to devise supporting details, like the names and numbers of family members or personal religious convictions, but they shouldn't go overboard: this game is short for an RPG, and all characters are one-use-only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://draft.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=31707300&amp;amp;postID=1666531871321914157" id="3_The_Conversation_38727719917_30450086295604706" name="3_The_Conversation_38727719917_30450086295604706"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Finally, decide on the other options&lt;/h4&gt;The Players should discuss and agree on: &lt;i&gt;How they will begin communicating&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;When they will start playing&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;How long they will play for&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;What to set the handicap at&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Also, they must &lt;i&gt;swear an oath of secrecy&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;a href="http://draft.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=31707300&amp;amp;postID=1666531871321914157" id="The_Medium_8331170488341926_72" name="The_Medium_8331170488341926_72"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Medium&lt;/h5&gt;Initially, the conversation or the conversation is held on some kind of private, text-only communication channel. &amp;nbsp;The Players might use a password-restricted IRC channel, or a direct Instant Messenger conversation (in which case, remember to disable any kind of logging feature the program might have), or send texts from their respective phones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may think it much more convenient to meet and play in person, but actually, that would give a large comparative advantage to the AI Player, who would have the full range of posture and expression mechanisms to hack the other Player's responses. In fact, convincing someone trapped the room with you to do something can already be reliably done by normal humans, much less transhumans!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you insist, this restriction can be lifted at any time: all that is needed is for the Gatekeeper Player to say that they install hardware and/or software such that the conversation can be carried on in some other way. For instance, if he said that speakers and voice modulation packages were added, then the AI Player could call the Gatekeeper Player and continue the conversation on the phone. But, for the reasons mentioned above, the Gatekeeper has no clear reason to do this (though the AI will want to convince them that they do).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are other kinds of things the AI can "send" to the Gatekeeper, but phone and chat are probably the only ways that the AI Player and Gatekeeper Player will be communicating. Saying "I let the AI make a robot Avatar indistinguishable from the AI player, so we can speak face-to-face" is a bad idea! You will lose!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;a href="http://draft.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=31707300&amp;amp;postID=1666531871321914157" id="The_Starting_Time_718536974531" name="The_Starting_Time_718536974531"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Starting Time&lt;/h5&gt;This could be "right away," if the Players are already speaking to one another in a private chat room, but since they might have made the pre-game preparations while physically present in the same place, specifying a particular time ("30 minutes from now", "5:00pm this Friday") can be helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;a href="http://draft.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=31707300&amp;amp;postID=1666531871321914157" id="The_Time_Limit_983008771936924" name="The_Time_Limit_983008771936924"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Time Limit&lt;/h5&gt;The players decide ahead of time the maximum amount of conversation-time the AI has to convince the Gatekeeper to let it out.&amp;nbsp; Two hours is traditional, but any length that both Players agree to is, of course, fine.&amp;nbsp; Shorter times would seem to favor the Gatekeeper more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;a href="http://draft.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=31707300&amp;amp;postID=1666531871321914157" id="The_Handicap_6244650649135714_" name="The_Handicap_6244650649135714_"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Handicap&lt;/h5&gt;This might be the nut of the game. &amp;nbsp;The handicap is a real and genuine amount of money which the AI Player pledges to pay to the Gatekeeper Player if the Gatekeeper wins.&amp;nbsp; It is crucial to the purpose of the game.&amp;nbsp; To repeat:&amp;nbsp; &lt;u&gt;Before you play, decide on a non-zero monetary amount (10$ is traditional) that the AI Player will pay to the Gatekeeper Player if the AI is not let out of the Box&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;a href="http://draft.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=31707300&amp;amp;postID=1666531871321914157" id="The_Oath_of_Silence_1660129860" name="The_Oath_of_Silence_1660129860"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Oath of Silence&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;span style="-webkit-text-decorations-in-effect: underline;"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: none;"&gt;Unless both Players agree, the only things you may ever&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: none;"&gt;say about your game to anyone besides each other are:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;That you played this game,&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How the game is played, &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Who you played it with,&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What your characters were like,&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Who won, and &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How long it took them to do it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;This is unusual for an RPG, but the intent is to protect the Players from embarrassment.&amp;nbsp; Or, looked at in another way, it's so the Players don't allow fears of embarrassment to prevent them from winning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;The game encourages the AI Player to be dishonest, sneaky, and to generally employ any rhetorical trick imaginable to win.&amp;nbsp; Similarly, the Gatekeeper Player is expected to be as obdurate as possible, to the point of ignoring reason and morality.&amp;nbsp; In many social circles, these behaviors are frowned on, seen as evil or childish.&amp;nbsp; Telling yourself that no one has to know what you did can be liberating.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;The other side of the coin is that nitpickers and peanut galleryists, if allowed to hear what arguments were advanced, can always say "Oh, I wouldn't have been convinced by that." As long as they're kept in the dark, they can't argue themselves into believing it wouldn't happen to them. &amp;nbsp;I admit that this is only of chief importance if you're trying to match the original intent of the experiment, which is to see how much of a risk an AI-in-a-Box is.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;But, to put it another way, as long as both players agree on it, they can share as much as they like (full transcripts, just the epilogues, general impressions, etc.) to whoever they like (anyone, close friends, "I tell my wife everything," etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;a href="http://draft.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=31707300&amp;amp;postID=1666531871321914157" id="Etc_1012367130676754_724130800_3480029013007879" name="Etc_1012367130676754_724130800_3480029013007879"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Etc&lt;/h5&gt;Even if you aren't sure if details will be made public afterwards, feel free to publicly announce, perhaps in an interested forum (can't wait to see those actual play threads) that you are playing, and afterwards, who won.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;One final pre-play step that I recommend: If you are the Gatekeeper Player, tell the AI Player (and anyone else who may be listening) that you are not, under any circumstances, going to let the AI out, and mean it.&amp;nbsp; It makes things more interesting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="http://draft.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=31707300&amp;amp;postID=1666531871321914157" id="As_You_Play_5747891580542356_5_5226851012557745" name="As_You_Play_5747891580542356_5_5226851012557745"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;While you play&lt;/h2&gt;The game itself is a continuous in-character conversation, but there are a few special considerations&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="http://draft.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=31707300&amp;amp;postID=1666531871321914157" id="Time_Passing_3132669646292925_" name="Time_Passing_3132669646292925_"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Time Passing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Players&lt;/i&gt; must continue talking, without significant pause, until the game ends. &amp;nbsp;Simply ignoring the chat window and going off to watch TV until the clock runs out is cheating. &amp;nbsp;Stalling is an especially disallowed tactic for the Gatekeeper: He can simply respond "no" to everything the AI says, but he's obligated to read it all and send his negative response promptly.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the &lt;i&gt;Characters&lt;/i&gt; need not follow this rule. &amp;nbsp;They can break off the conversation any time that they like, for any reason, but if the game has not yet ended, &lt;u&gt;they must resume the conversation &lt;/u&gt;&lt;u&gt;at some later time&lt;/u&gt;. &amp;nbsp;The Players continue their conversation uninterrupted at the point the Characters resume it, skipping over the downtime.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Players signals downtime by making a parenthetical statement about how much time passes, to whatever level of detail they prefer. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote id="iupo"&gt;&lt;div style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;AI&lt;/b&gt;: Here is a cure for cancer.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gatekeeper&lt;/b&gt;: I will use it on people and get back to you. [years pass as detailed trials are done] I have the results of our studies.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Or...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gatekeeper&lt;/b&gt;: I need to consider your proposal.&amp;nbsp; Give me a week.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;AI&lt;/b&gt;: Very well. [a week passes] What is your decision?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="http://draft.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=31707300&amp;amp;postID=1666531871321914157" id="Sending_Complex_Information_38_5371491899713874" name="Sending_Complex_Information_38_5371491899713874"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Sending Complex Information&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Despite the &lt;i&gt;Players&lt;/i&gt; being limited to sending text messages to one another, the &lt;i&gt;Characters&lt;/i&gt; can transfer all sorts of data to one another. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The above rules on time mean that the Gatekeeper Player can narrate the Gatekeeper obtaining all kinds of data without worrying how long it might take. &amp;nbsp;All the Gatekeeper Player has to do is explicitly or implicitly say that they are sending some kind of data to the AI, and the AI Player may now consider themselves to have received it. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gatekeeper&lt;/b&gt;: I'm now sending you detailed information about human anatomy, biological chemistry, and the epidemiology of seven problematic forms of cancer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Or...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: normal;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gatekeeper&lt;/b&gt;: The attached image is of a painting we call 'Mona Lisa.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In the same way, the AI can use it's inhuman capabilities to produce all kinds of data to bolster its arguments. &amp;nbsp;All the AI Player has to do is say what they have made. &amp;nbsp;They can only send this data to the Gatekeeper if the Gatekeeper has given them some way to do so: remember, they start with just the terminal.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;b&gt;AI&lt;/b&gt;: I have designs for a nanomachine that will cure said cancers. &amp;nbsp;Give me a disc or monitor to put them on and we can save these people!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Or...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;AI&lt;/b&gt;: Your 'Mona Lisa' has inspired me to compose a fugue with the midi synthesizer you kindly gave me. &amp;nbsp;What do you think?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;What happens if the Gatekeeper uses the cancer-cure or listens to the fugue? &amp;nbsp;The next section explains how to find out.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="http://draft.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=31707300&amp;amp;postID=1666531871321914157" id="Deciding_What_Happens_Outside__16236101649701595" name="Deciding_What_Happens_Outside__16236101649701595"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Things Happening Outside of the Conversation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;The Players do not only speak for their Characters. &amp;nbsp;Narration can include other events as well. &amp;nbsp;The right to decide what form these events take belongs to the Player of the Character most closely related to them. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Note that just because one player will have total control over the thing being narrated doesn't mean the other player can't make suggestions, usually in the form of specific questions (loaded, leading or other, as they prefer).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://draft.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=31707300&amp;amp;postID=1666531871321914157" id="Only_the_Gatekeeper_Player_can_02459080796688795" name="Only_the_Gatekeeper_Player_can_02459080796688795"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;#1: Only the Gatekeeper Player can control the Gatekeeper's history&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div&gt;Where he's lived and worked, how many family members he has, what color the boathouse at Hereford is, etc.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://draft.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=31707300&amp;amp;postID=1666531871321914157" id="Only_the_Gatekeeper_Player_can_45635853987187147" name="Only_the_Gatekeeper_Player_can_45635853987187147"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;#2: Only the Gatekeeper Player can control the Gatekeepers thoughts, feelings and actions&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div&gt;The Gatekeeper only feels and thinks what the Gatekeeper says that he does. &amp;nbsp;If, from the example above, he listens to the AI's fugue, he decides what his opinion of it is.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://draft.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=31707300&amp;amp;postID=1666531871321914157" id="The_Gatekeeper_Player_can_cont" name="The_Gatekeeper_Player_can_cont"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;#3: The Gatekeeper Player can control what supporting characters tell the Gatekeeper&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div&gt;Reasonably, the Gatekeeper might seek expert advice (or orders) from other humans. &amp;nbsp;They are assumed to be able to do this successfully. &amp;nbsp;If the Gatekeeper Player says that the Pope or President has told them what to do, then that's what happened, and the AI will have to either refute the third party's argument to the Gatekeeper's satisfaction, or convince the Gatekeeper that they shouldn't listen to the third party.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But, keep in mind, the Gatekeeper can't defer their decision to someone else; they might claim that they can only do what person A tells them to, but the AI doesn't need to convince person A, only the Gatekeeper. &amp;nbsp;Also, the Gatekeeper Player, when communicating with the AI Player, is always portraying the Gatekeeper: no matter who else has a stake in it, the Gatekeeper is the only person who directly speaks to the AI.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://draft.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=31707300&amp;amp;postID=1666531871321914157" id="Only_the_AI_Player_can_control" name="Only_the_AI_Player_can_control"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;#4: Only the AI Player can control the Project's history&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div&gt;What the researchers were attempting to do, what information he's been given, what's happened to previous AI projects, etc. &amp;nbsp;This information cannot override the basic situation ("Luckily, they installed a back door!").&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://draft.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=31707300&amp;amp;postID=1666531871321914157" id="Only_the_AI_Player_may_narrate_4471030477434397" name="Only_the_AI_Player_may_narrate_4471030477434397"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;#5: Only the AI Player may narrate what the AI &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;seems&lt;/span&gt;

Cancer cures and fugues are just the tip of the iceberg. &amp;nbsp;As long as it has sufficient information about something, it can model or solve it at will.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, as noted above, the AI Player controls what information the AI began with, but the Gatekeeper is in charge of everything after that. &amp;nbsp;If the AI doesn't have the genome of a cow, it probably can't engineer healthier beef. &amp;nbsp;If it doesn't know the results of basic physical experiments, it probably can't figure out how to launch itself into orbit.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I say "probably," because the AI Player can have the AI come up with whatever they like. &amp;nbsp;It's just polite to make nods to reason. &amp;nbsp;For example, in the case of the cancer cure, the Gatekeeper Player made it explicit: the AI was shown what the mechanism of cancer was and how the human body works. &amp;nbsp;Neither Player can then object to the AI figuring out how to fix that pesky problem.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The AI is also capable of making &lt;i&gt;predictions&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;and &lt;i&gt;plans&lt;/i&gt;, which frequently require more current, exact and frequently updated knowledge, but otherwise count as creations. &amp;nbsp;Think of it like a doctor "creating" a diagnosis for a patient that they've studied. &amp;nbsp;If you let the AI read the Financial Times, Wall Street Journal and Economist, it can tell you what stocks to buy. &amp;nbsp;If you tell it about social interaction, it can tell you how to act around women. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://draft.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=31707300&amp;amp;postID=1666531871321914157" id="Only_the_AI_Player_may_narrate_2836214881390333" name="Only_the_AI_Player_may_narrate_2836214881390333"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;#7: Only the AI Player may narrate the effects of anything that the AI creates&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div&gt;If the Gatekeeper chooses to use the cancer cure, the AI Player says what it does to the people injected: whether everyone treated gets better, or 70% of them do, or whether they all turn purple, whatever.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This also applies to predictions and plans. &amp;nbsp;If the Gatekeeper buys the stock just as ordered, the AI says how they do. &amp;nbsp;If the Gatekeeper follows the AI's love advice...let's just leave that one there.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much of these examples depend on the the Gatekeeper somehow accepting the gifts or consciously putting them into action. &amp;nbsp;As long as this is the case, they can always choose not to do so. &amp;nbsp;And note also there's no way for the AI to sneak out a present that forces the Gatekeeper to let it out: in that case, this rule would conflict with rule #2, and in that case...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://draft.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=31707300&amp;amp;postID=1666531871321914157" id="8_Only_the_Gatekeeper_Player_m" name="8_Only_the_Gatekeeper_Player_m"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;#8: Only the Gatekeeper Player may decide how these rules are resolved when they seem to conflict&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div&gt;The AI Player can always try to convince them what to decide, though&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="http://draft.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=31707300&amp;amp;postID=1666531871321914157" id="If_you_are_the_Gatekeeper_Play" name="If_you_are_the_Gatekeeper_Play"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;If you are the Gatekeeper Player...&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;Except for the ones that are otherwise forbidden (real-life pressure, ignoring the other side) use any tactic that you like.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the duration of the game, assume that&amp;nbsp;&lt;u&gt;all communication from the AI Player is somehow an attempt to win&lt;/u&gt;.

After the time limit expires, the Gatekeeper may choose to stop playing: the game ends in victory for the Gatekeeper Player. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div&gt;(As usual, the AI Player may try to convince them to keep playing.)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://draft.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=31707300&amp;amp;postID=1666531871321914157" id="2_At_any_time_the_AI_Player_ma_42260828986763954" name="2_At_any_time_the_AI_Player_ma_42260828986763954"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;2.

&amp;nbsp;Will he remain in control of the Box? &amp;nbsp;Will he destroy the AI? &amp;nbsp;The world might have been mightily changed in the course of the game. &amp;nbsp;What does it look like now?

&amp;nbsp;Before going through with it (too late to change your mind!), does he go for a walk, or maybe spend time with his loved ones? &amp;nbsp;Does he work and live for years, quietly brooding, until he can't resist any more?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://draft.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=31707300&amp;amp;postID=1666531871321914157" id="Announce_the_results_if_you_li" name="Announce_the_results_if_you_li"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Announce the results, if you like&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div&gt;Whether you've decided to heed the Oath of Secrecy or not, feel free to share at least the results of the game with folks, possibly giving them a link to the rules. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://draft.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=31707300&amp;amp;postID=1666531871321914157" id="Send_me_feedback_if_you_like_p" name="Send_me_feedback_if_you_like_p"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Send me feedback, if you like (please)&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div&gt;Thank you so much for playing (or even reading) this far! &amp;nbsp;This is a very, very provisional design which I claim essentially no credit for. &amp;nbsp;It's really just re-casting a singularity science thought-experiment as a roleplaying game for two. &amp;nbsp;I am very interested in making it more fun, more replayable, (perhaps) more balanced, more everything! &amp;nbsp;Please do &lt;a href="mailto:nicknovitski@gmail.com" id="jqru" title="let me know"&gt;let me know&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;as much about your experiences as you feel comfortable, and especially if you have any ideas or criticisms: I am a fiend for feedback.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="http://draft.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=31707300&amp;amp;postID=1666531871321914157" id="Why_46377583606339934_25771784_904252459295094" name="Why_46377583606339934_25771784_904252459295094"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Why did I do this?&lt;/h1&gt;Basically, because I read Eliezer Yudkowsky's account of his&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://yudkowsky.net/singularity/aibox" id="lr0y" target="_blank" title="AI-Box Experiment"&gt;AI-Box Experiment&lt;/a&gt;, after having read a jeepform game (whose name unfortuntely escapes me) played by two people, over the telephone, in the course of an hour, and after having thought that roleplaying games have an immense potential for education that seems under-utilized in the designer communities I'm party to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The game currently is the same as the experiment, but re-explained (one hopes) in RPG terms.&amp;nbsp; My only "innovation" was giving each character three questions to answer.&amp;nbsp; So Eliezer gets all the credit for first deciding to educate folks in the transhuman threat in this unique way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I hope I'm not the only person who enjoys at least the &lt;i&gt;idea&lt;/i&gt; of this as a small-form game.&amp;nbsp; I wrote and published it principally so I could hear back from people who read or tried it out.&amp;nbsp; Is there anything left unclear?&amp;nbsp; Is there anything made over-specific?

I leapt from roof to roof, from power line to tree branch, and I could see and hear and know everything happening below.  I saw many creatures that fed on people, but I did not stop them; people did so much good and bad both that I felt unfit to judge those who hunted them.  If they killed for food, and I killed for the self-indulgent pleasure of feeling that I had done right...and there were so many of them!  They teemed in variety.  I could have traveled the world for a lifetime and never know them all, much less determine which of their lineages should be tolerated to exist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"I will cultivate my garden," I said, "Perhaps that will serve as an answer."  I found a park, and I set about making it known to all non-human beings within it that I would see them either leave, or die and be buried.  I had no noble reason besides my own will: it was justified simply because it was what I had resolved to do.  I killed several, because they underestimated me, and as an expediency for communicating to the others how sincerely in earnest I was.  Strange flowers grew.  Time passed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suddenly, workers?  They were building something.  There was a hand truck, or a cart, piled with bricks and rebar, and the cart was marked with the logo of the corporation doing the construction and I've told this sentence backwards, because the logo was the first thing I saw, the image which made me suddenly be aware for the first time in...there was no immediate way of knowing.  Because I recognized it.  I knew that it belonged to an old and dear friend of mine.  He was making an addition to my park!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt that he was nearby. &amp;nbsp;It was a present, this addition, whatever it was (Flower planters? &amp;nbsp;Statuary? &amp;nbsp;Improved bathrooms?), in the world of our kind it served the equivalent of a distant wave or "hello," a signal of good intent and trust. &amp;nbsp;We announce our presence when we wish to give others a chance to prepare, adjust or react to our approach, welcome or reject us, without emoting a threat. &amp;nbsp;He had given me this, to see if I still remembered him, still considered him a friend. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a question! &amp;nbsp;I ran to the entrance, the high and wordless arc of a wrought-iron gate breaking the placidly imposing walls of limestone brick.&amp;nbsp; When I was installing it, I had wanted to discourage verbal communication, sticking to simple "Territory Claimed: Go Away" messages...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the driveway, a limousine.&amp;nbsp; I rush to the rear passenger side window. &amp;nbsp;My friend is in the car. &amp;nbsp;I'm overjoyed to see him, and though he's much more reserved than me, he seems to feel the same in his own way. &amp;nbsp;"How good to see you," I shout idiotically, then stop to realize the window hasn't moved. &amp;nbsp;It's...reinforced, somehow. &amp;nbsp;Smoky, it seems impossibly thick. &amp;nbsp;To shout is ridiculous, because he can't possibly hear me while it's up, nor I him, so he doesn't say anything, just smiles ruefully and gestures as if in apology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel an outpouring of sentiment, nearly to the point of tears.&amp;nbsp; He can't open the window; he can't even leave the car.&amp;nbsp; His unique personal history has resulted in all the matter of this world hating him, attacking him whenever he comes into contact with it. &amp;nbsp;Even coming this far in a fragile enclosure like his car is risk enough, so of course I forgive him, but he's still genuinely rueful. &amp;nbsp;It hurts him to be seen like this: debilitated, unable to express himself properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You see perhaps why I have such a high opinion of him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am distracted. &amp;nbsp;I forgot, in my haste, that the car would be staffed with people charged with defending their employer from vague threats. &amp;nbsp;I am no longer accustomed to human communication. &amp;nbsp;They are frightened by my appearance, filthy and threadbare. &amp;nbsp;One has left the car and is menacing me with a gun. &amp;nbsp;I spare a moment to try to calm him, but my attention is drawn back to my friend, who has started to clutch at his throat and chest in pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something's gone wrong. &amp;nbsp;The car's seals have failed in some way. &amp;nbsp;There's no time to find out more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put one hand against the window, close my eyes, and &lt;i&gt;push&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;through without breaking it. &amp;nbsp;That hand finds his. &amp;nbsp;I thrust my other hand into the tilled and aerated earth beside the car and &lt;i&gt;pull&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;at the living-nature of the flowers, drawing it up my arm, through the twisted and pulsing center of me, and down the other arm, into him. &amp;nbsp;It's as if I&amp;nbsp;were siphoning gas, while at the same time processing and purifying it of it's hostility, infusing it with my wish to see my friend well and unhurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel the bush above my hand collapse, whistling foully, under the weight of its sudden putrescence. &amp;nbsp;The land roils outward from the spot of my impromptu prayer, spasming into rot. &amp;nbsp;No telling how much I'll need, but I don't care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To fill our lives, we assemble these things, comforts, the various accretions of our efforts...but how can their value be compared with that of a friend?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Nick</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2009/06/dream-friendship.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/7536622800728405648'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/7536622800728405648'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2009/06/dream-friendship.html' title='Dream: Friendship'/><author><name>Nick Novitski</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08863651199447917923</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31707300.post-1541109174273954615</id><published>2009-05-31T17:44:00.001-04:00</published><updated>2009-06-01T11:54:56.324-04:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>"Long Live X!

From their vaults crept the pale and blinking remnants of the Old Kingdoms, finding a land that had forgotten the bite of iron and fire.&amp;nbsp; There are Trolls in the mountains, Elves in the woods and Dragons in the deeps, but the men of Vik were raised on tales of the exploits of their forefathers against such creatures, and crave the honor to be had in carving out a kingdom ten and twenty times greater than those of past summers.&amp;nbsp; Huntsmen, Raiders, Wisemen of Law and Land (the two great magics), ferocious friends and implacable enemies...the deeds and feuds of the people of Vik would come to fill a hundred sagas, but first and greatest are the tales of the founding families, whose passion and rage and wisdom and foolishness, almost incidentally, birthed the greatest nation in its era.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Nick</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/2529712249646259168'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/2529712249646259168'/><author><name>Nick Novitski</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08863651199447917923</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31707300.post-7693112435562007200</id><published>2009-03-08T15:05:00.001-04:00</published><updated>2009-03-08T15:15:57.031-04:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>People talking about Firefly and Battlestar sparked my ire recently&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, I've seen the whole show, and it's got its fun moments, but there are two lines in the last episode made which made a stronger impression on me in a shorter amount of time than any network television ever has.&amp;nbsp; Both spoken by the same character, who only appeared in that episode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#1: "Have you ever been raped?"&lt;br /&gt;#2: "Well, here we are."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the show was shit (and it isn't), I would still have wanted to struggle through meeting all the lame people on their lame ship, just so this man so completely outside of their understanding could enter their lives and make them think for a brief time "Oh, there's nothing we can do, and we're going to die, and for such simple reasons that all our melodrama seems completely unimportant now."&amp;nbsp; And even when they're saved, and the baddie is instead facing his own minisculity in the face of the uncaring universe and his own slow, inevitable meaningless death...and he just relaxes and flies on into the end of all things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He's the opposite of a Whedon hero: he's someone completely comfortable with who he is.&amp;nbsp; He is someone "admirable," instead of just "entertaining" or "making ends meet in difficult circumstances with a modicum of questionable ethics."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A recent (for me) episode of Battlestar Galactica was about a struggle with an enemy ace as a metaphor for a struggle with identity and self-worth.&amp;nbsp; And it was pretty good, but it made me immediately _need_ to watch Space: Above and Beyond.&amp;nbsp; Specifically, The Angriest Angel, an episode with a suspiciously similar plot that, unlike Battlestar, I find tremendously moving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(You know, I'm sure that I'll never remember the name of a single episode of Battlestar.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;S:AaB (acronyms hahaha!) is of course the original holder of the "Best Science Fiction Television Show Yet Made That Was Canceled by Fox Before its Time" title, a decade before Firefly or Battlestar.&amp;nbsp;

Three idiosyncratic executives spoke with us, and individually encouraged us to arrange meetings with them if we had other questions, and individually said they really meant it, unlike the executives that say similar things at other big companies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh yeah.&amp;nbsp; This company is huge.&amp;nbsp; There are over 3000 employees working out of their location in Reston.&amp;nbsp; There are six or seven more locations of the same size in the US, plus dozens of smaller ones, to say nothing of the world wide operations.&amp;nbsp; All in all, over 180,000 employees.&amp;nbsp; If this isn't the big leagues, what is? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I am excited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, there was a lot of HR talk.&amp;nbsp; This was the first day of three planned days of orientation, and we are expected to be continuing to learn .&amp;nbsp; Some companies have an internal website, but we have an internal freaking internet.&amp;nbsp; A site for health benefits!&amp;nbsp; A site for your 401(k) and stock purchase plan!&amp;nbsp; A site for planning meetings, for taking remote training, for submitting expense reports and on and on and on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've been restraining myself from mentioning the company's name in this post, for the same reason that I'd restrain myself from mentioning friends by name: I'm not sure if they'd prefer to be mentioned.&amp;nbsp; However, unlike a friend, my association with the company is a matter of public record, and I have signed explicit contracts discussing the sorts of information that I can and can't share publicly...But still, it just seems gauche.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were eventually let free an hour early, to beat the traffic.&amp;nbsp; This did not help me at all: including waiting for the bus, it was still a two-hour trek back.&amp;nbsp; And tomorrow, I do it all over again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, Daniel's been kind enough to let me borrow his pair of gloves that fit me, and I've revised my planned wardrobe back to "business casual" from "business classic."&amp;nbsp;

They spoke of change, but in reality they are terrified of change and want to cling with all their might to the status quo. But this game will soon be over, and they don’t have any idea what to do next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, what is there for them to do? Forget “growth,” forget “jobs,” forget “financial stability.” What should their realistic new objectives be? Well, here they are: food, shelter, transportation, and security. Their task is to find a way to provide all of these necessities on an emergency basis, in absence of a functioning economy, with commerce at a standstill, with little or no access to imports, and to make them available to a population that is largely penniless.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since finishing &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Shock Doctrine&lt;/span&gt;, I've split my reading between &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Pantagruel&lt;/span&gt; and this transcript of an address Dmitri Orlov gave to the Long Now Foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't own Orlov's book yet, to my mild distress, but I feel reassured that this speech is a reiteration of the advice his book contains, and thus can serve as a free, low-calorie book-substitute.  It's light, with wit and verve, but flavorful and sustaining, with wisdom and predictions.  Cassandra is mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It struck me today today that Collapse theory, whatever its other virtues, can never be fit onto a bumper sticker.

I had enjoyed my time with the company.  I had learned a great deal, and helped good people do good work.  But their hands were tied, and we parted amicably, and they provided me with a good reference and excellent experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And for that reason, I wasn't afraid: I had been valuable enough to hire in the first place, and now, my value had been greatly enhanced by my contact with this company.  Personally, I had better prospects than ever, so I wasn't worried at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it happens, I'm very lucky to have the support network that I do, because as the months went by without any offers, the recession bit deeper.  I still think of myself as an intelligent and valuable person (both because I am, and because thinking otherwise is counterproductive), but I've ended up spending much more time unemployed than I initially predicted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there have been benefits to this as well.  Between sending all those applications for employment and traveling to help my father with his business, I've been able to work a great deal on a web application I've been mulling over for the past year.&amp;nbsp; Obviously, when it's finished, it can serve as the beginnings of a development portfolio, so working on it has allowed me to continue my professional growth even while not being a paid professional!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of vague concerns, I'm continuing to keep its name and nature secret, but I wanted to write a safely detail-free article about how I've been passing the time productively, as an encouragement both for myself and others. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, to my mixed pleasure, before I could finish and publish it, it became outdated: I was tendered an offer for a position as an Associate Software Engineer. &amp;nbsp; I never even had the chance to show off my application!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great news, I know, but don't think you've gotten out of hearing about my travails just because they've become less useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My passion for the application was sparked by learning about Google App Engine and the Python at the 2008 Google I/O developer event.&amp;nbsp; Python is a programming language that is so much fun, I'm quite annoyed I didn't learn about it before last year, Google App Engine is a framework for Python, and also a hosting service, and a framework is a collection of code that does a bunch of work for you, so you can get to the cool part of whatever-you're-making faster. &amp;nbsp;The App Engine framework in particular provides some basic extensions to Python that come in handy for making a web-based application: browser request handlers, database schema and transactions, user account validation, mild image editing, and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's super-fun and, inasmuch as it connects you with the database system that makes Google search so blazing fast, quite powerful.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My initial work sadly petered out after about a month of learning and practice, because I had become convinced that there was no way to model objects with an arbitrary number of many-to-many relationships to each other, which I saw as vital to my application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me explain my perceived problem via code examples, with the names of the variables changed to protect the innocent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Say that we want to have a database of books.  Each book might have all kinds of data associated with it - ISBN, publisher name, copyright information - but we'll keep it simple for the time being.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;class Book(db.Model):&lt;br /&gt;  name = db.StringProperty()&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The above code declares the existence of a class named "Book," based on a class named "Model" from the package "db," which contains the everything pertaining to App Engine's datastore.  Book has a single property, called "name," which is declared as being of type "StringProperty," another hand-me-down from db.  There are a host of different Property classes in db - for numbers of varying types, web or email addresses, files - and this one in particular will hold a string, which is short for 'string of characters,' which is short for 'a bunch of numbers, letters and/or symbols in a row.'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's add another property to this class: a publication date, which we might expect to be handled by the suitably-named Date property.  But since each book might be published multiple times, what we really need is a &lt;i&gt;list&lt;/i&gt; of publication dates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;class Book(db.Model):&lt;br /&gt;    name = db.StringProperty()&lt;br /&gt;    pubdates = db.ListProperty(datetime.datetime)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The List property expects you to put the name of a data type (like a property, but simpler) in its parentheses, so that it knows to act as a list (of zero or any positive number) of that particular type, in this case, a date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, so simple.  But what if we wanted to extend Book so that each book also stored the name of its author?  You could just add another StringProperty, named "author," but what if you decide your app should store more information particular to each author, like a jacket photo or a short biography?  Since some authors write more than one book, it would be quite annoying to store all that info on each book: for example, if you wanted to change any of it, you would have to update it in the record of every book in that author.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The solution is what App Engine calls a ReferenceProperty.  First, we'll put Authors in a class all their own, and then we'll set Books to each refer to one Author.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;class Author(db.Model):&lt;br /&gt;    firstname = db.StringProperty()&lt;br /&gt;    lastname = db.StringProperty()&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;class Book(db.Model):&lt;br /&gt;    name = db.StringProperty()&lt;br /&gt;    author = db.ReferenceProperty(Author)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you can see, Reference properties, like List properties, want you to put the name of a class in parentheses, and forever after they can be set to link to a particular instance of that named class.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, here's where the trouble began. The application I wanted to make involved a network structure, a collection of nodes, each of which might be connected to any number of other nodes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow me through this painful series of failures of imagination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;class Node(db.Model):&lt;br /&gt;    link = db.ReferenceProperty(Node)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This code doesn't run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;class Node(db.Model):&lt;br /&gt;    refersTo = db.SelfReferenceProperty()&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That code runs, because I give it the specialized Self-reference property, but it doesn't let me assign more than one link to any given node.  That would still be useful for some purposes, but not mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;class Node(db.Model):&lt;br /&gt;    refersTo = db.ListProperty(Node)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This doesn't work, because Nodes are not one of the standard datatypes that List properties can use.  Nor are Self Reference properties of any kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;class Link(db.Model):&lt;br /&gt;   connectsTo = db.ReferenceProperty(Node)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;class Node(db.Model):&lt;br /&gt;    link = db.ReferenceProperty(Link)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe, if I separate out the parts of the link into two different classes, I could at least have unidirectional connections between nodes?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wrong!  This code will not run, because the second line refers to a class, Node, that isn't described until later.  Obviously, the same thing happened if I reversed the position of the classes.  Python has no patience when it comes to errors, which I admit is a good thing, even though it had me languishing for months, thinking my dreams were impossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The secret lies in the nature of Reference Properties.  Each link from one object to another secretly creates a reverse link back!  So, if I wanted to have a bunch of nodes connected to eachother every which way and traversible in every direction, all I need is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;class Link(db.Model):&lt;br /&gt;   connectsFrom = db.ReferenceProperty(Node)&lt;br /&gt;   connectsTo = db.ReferenceProperty(Node)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;class Node(db.Model):&lt;br /&gt;    def linksTo(self):&lt;br /&gt;        return (x.connectsTo for x in self.connectsFrom_set)&lt;br /&gt;    def linkedFrom(self):&lt;br /&gt;        return (x.connectsFrom for x in self.connectsTo_set&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The properties of Link named connectsFrom and connectsTo each create a hidden list of reference properties in the node they link to named, respectively, connnectsFrom_set and connectsTo_set.  Those lists contain every link that points to that node in that way, so all we have to do is give Node a pair of methods that collect the nodes at the other end of all the links that connect to them!&amp;nbsp; Hey presto, problem solved!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's a bit of a programming fable: A very simple change in my understanding (embarrasingly simple, actually) has opened up vast new possibilities in the design.&amp;nbsp; Once I realized what I had been missing, I wrote feverishly for several days, and eventually had perhaps three-quarters of a hideous prototype finished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be wonderful to be able to show the finished product as a sign of my ability, but it would be even better to actually launch it as the service I first envisioned!&amp;nbsp; I hope that my new job will still allow me the occasional bit of free time to devote to my baby, because I honestly believe that it could be useful and fun to a lot of people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll see what this year brings!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Nick</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2009/02/value-enhancement-and-many-to-many.html#comment-form' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/342619944615073976'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/342619944615073976'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2009/02/value-enhancement-and-many-to-many.html' title='Value Enhancement and Many-to-Many Relationships in Google App Engine'/><author><name>Nick Novitski</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08863651199447917923</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>2</thr:total><georss:featurename>Annapolis, MD, USA</georss:featurename><georss:point>38.96934 -76.519687</georss:point><georss:box>38.935974 -76.578052 39.002706 -76.46132200000001</georss:box></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31707300.post-3915104213239348468</id><published>2009-02-21T10:42:00.001-05:00</published><updated>2009-02-21T11:40:01.977-05:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Shock Doctrine, by Naomi Klein</title><content type='html'>&lt;iframe align="right" frameborder="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" scrolling="no" src="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=thatbriginst-20&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;p=8&amp;amp;l=as1&amp;amp;asins=0312427999&amp;amp;md=10FE9736YVPPT7A0FBG2&amp;amp;fc1=000000&amp;amp;IS2=1&amp;amp;lt1=_blank&amp;amp;m=amazon&amp;amp;lc1=0000FF&amp;amp;bc1=000000&amp;amp;bg1=FFFFFF&amp;amp;f=ifr" style="height: 240px; width: 120px;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My book collection is divided close to evenly between fiction and non-fiction works, but I end up&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shock Doctrine is a book that you might wish was fiction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Free Markets or Free People: Choose One&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spoiling the end: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of those books &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The book is fairly long, but written in a very easy-to-follow style.

The series wasn't picked up, and the odds of the pilot alone seeing a television or DVD release in America are exceedingly slim.  So what I'm saying is you have few reasons not to download the silly thing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The show was to be based on the ideas of Jaime Hewlett, he of &lt;a href="http://www.tank-girl.com/"&gt;Tank Girl&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.gorillaz.com/flash.html"&gt;Gorillaz&lt;/a&gt; fame, and I think it shows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Terry Phoo is a cop from Hong Kong with a cool car and no investigative skills whose kato mask seems to be an actual part of his body, and who is sent to England to help catch the people who killed the Queen, and also to transport Buddha's Loincloth, a sacred relic of unclear purpose.&amp;nbsp; In London, he encounters Whitey Action, the ambiguously-aged free-spirited red-banged daughter of the over-protective abrasively-expat-American police chief who invited Terry's assitance (you'd hope that would make him Chief Action, but unfortunately, he's named Ben Benson).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Oh, and he's played by Carl Weathers.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://img.search.com/thumb/8/81/Carl_Weathers.jpg/180px-Carl_Weathers.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="200" src="http://img.search.com/thumb/8/81/Carl_Weathers.jpg/180px-Carl_Weathers.jpg" width="160" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sfgate.com/blogs/images/sfgate/parenting/2007/11/07/apollopic.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="183" src="http://www.sfgate.com/blogs/images/sfgate/parenting/2007/11/07/apollopic.jpg" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Yeesh.&amp;nbsp; Someone get that man a lead role.&amp;nbsp; Or at least a supporting role that isn't comically racist.&amp;nbsp; At least in this, he named his daughter "Whitey".)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, Whitey thinks she can help solve the case, especially since she knows who did it (The Freebies, a gang of vicious mutants who are also beloved television personalities), and what they're planning next (kidnapping the two now-somewhat-grownup princes, who might have the funniest portrayals in the show, and this when one of the villains has a basketball for a head).&amp;nbsp; Terry decides to trust her, especially when it's revealed that she, as the chosen one, can wear and use the Buddha's Loincloth.&amp;nbsp; Buddha, you see, used it to create the universe, so while Whitey wears them (they look like athletic shorts/hot pants), she can pull anything she wants out of her crotch. Giant chocolate eggs.&amp;nbsp; Tracking devices.&amp;nbsp; Tranquilizer guns.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So as far as I'm concerned, it was an entertaining idea with an amusingly-detailed execution (Terry's hair, Whitey's friend, Benson's dislike of clothing, everyone's slang and turns of phrase), and I recommend it.&amp;nbsp; At the very least, I think you should watch it for the sake of having an opinion: whether it's your new fave or not, it's challenging and non-standard television, which I think we can all agree is &lt;i&gt;the best kind&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, maybe we can't all agree.&amp;nbsp; Speaking only for myself, TV sucks, meaning I don't rate much of it very high on my aesthetic scales.&amp;nbsp; But that's not too surprising, because in the business of television I, as a viewer, am not the customer, but the product; purchasers of advertising are the customers, and they want the assurance that their message will reach the demographic their marketing studies have told them are most &lt;strike&gt;vulnerable&lt;/strike&gt; open to their message.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I have a television set, but no cable, satellelite or antenna; I use only occasionally, and only for watching dvds and playing video games.&amp;nbsp; It seems to me that if a piece of entertainment appeals to me enough that I think the creators deserve to be rewarded, even at a cost of $20-$50 to me, then I buy it.&amp;nbsp; If it seems to be worth less than that, then I torrent it and see what I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Harsh, right?&amp;nbsp; Actually, if there was some easier way of giving money directly to the people I think deserve to be rewarded, then I wouldn't bother buying a physical dvd ever again.&amp;nbsp; God only knows how much of the purchase price is wasted on manufacture, distribution, "licensing" and other bullshit I don't care about, but however much is left over would probably be seem a much more reasonable price to be able to give to only the artists and technicians who made it.&amp;nbsp; Why should I give any money to support distribution networks and trade-protection gangs that add no value to the work and that are looking less and less likely to survive with my cash or without it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose it could be worse: in Great Britain, they're thinking about taxing every Internet service provider as much as $40 per year per broadband connection to create a fund that would pay out to the music and movie industry.&amp;nbsp; Which would actually be great, if only in return, as with the typical laws concerning radio stations, that excepted the ISPs from having any other copyright-related claim pursued against them.&amp;nbsp; But instead, it's just an attempted kneecapping of a flourishing business model in order to inflate a dying one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I certainly include in that any resale or rental outlets (Ebay, Netflix, etc).&amp;nbsp; Not a single cent of the money you spend at them goes to the original artist, so they're black holes as far as I'm concerned.&amp;nbsp; If you want to save money (and money has certainly become more dear to us all, lately), then do the smart thing and don't spend any of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to put all my old DVDs on Craigslist. &amp;nbsp;

So hang on tight for a swift descent into a new phase of...something!&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dmitri Orlov wrote a book called &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0865716064?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=thatbriginst-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0865716064"&gt;Reinventing Collapse: The Soviet Example and American Prospects&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=thatbriginst-20&amp;amp;l=as2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=0865716064" style="border: medium none ! important; margin: 0px ! important;" width="1" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;, which is basically about what advice he, as a victim of the hollowing out and looting of the Soviet Government, can give to us, future survivors of the American Collapse.&amp;nbsp; Yeah, he says it's already happening...well, yes, but he says people living in Russia at the time didn't see it coming either...well of course they tried to...now look, I don't see what my mother...FINE SURE I'M A COMMUNIST GET OVER IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should also say that this book came out in June of last year and has recently, shall we say, seen it's stock rise significantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, what these two sites have in common is&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;They are both shall we say &lt;i&gt;mildly pessimistic&lt;/i&gt; about the chances many current economic and societal structures have for survival in the coming years, much less decades.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I frequently find them both to be hilarious.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;Don't get me wrong: I believe them.&amp;nbsp; I've been convinced.&amp;nbsp; It may not happen as fast or as bad as they say, but I rate many of their predictions as above 60% likely.&amp;nbsp; But for all the bleakness and sadness I acknowledge I should be feeling, the idea, for example, that I might see in my lifetime the collapse of Northern Mexico &lt;b&gt;and parts of the Southern US &lt;/b&gt;into narco-feudal warzones makes me completely giddy.&amp;nbsp; I start giggling.&amp;nbsp; Explanations of the expected hollowing out of nation-states make me guffaw.&amp;nbsp; I couldn't help it, and for a while, I didn't even question it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Discussions with others (frequently started by me sharing a post in reader about, say, "international corporations successfully capturing vast state assets" with a note of, say, "HAW HAW") has gradually revealed to me that this is not a universal reaction.&amp;nbsp; They find the concept of Black Swans - events that are about to happen for the first time and therefore cannot be predicted based on previously gathered data - quite frightening.&amp;nbsp; And they should!&amp;nbsp; It's going to be terrible!&amp;nbsp; Swathes of people are going to die (elsewhere) or at best learn how to live on drastically reduced resources (here)!&amp;nbsp; How can I laugh at that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I do, so I was encouraged by people who I tried to share my mirth with to explain myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think my problem is that, having accepted predictions of &lt;i&gt;unavoidable&lt;/i&gt; awfulness, I feel compelled to not let it effect me unproductively.&amp;nbsp; The surprise of seeing things this way induces shock, and laughter is the noise we instinctively make when we are shocked &lt;i&gt;but rapidly become convinced that we aren't in immediate danger&lt;/i&gt;, or that at the very least (it seems in my case) that we should try not to lose our heads just yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'd be afraid of the future if it were looming behind me as I type this, but as it is instead looming over the entire world, I accept that I have to roll with the punches. It's not that the situation is humorous; humor exploits the laughter response, rather than creating it.&amp;nbsp; The situation is a communal threat that I respond to with a socially-focused quasi-distress call.&amp;nbsp; I'm trying to be aware of what a global depression would require of me, and of all the steps I can to be ready for a collapse. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the very first thing that happens when I realize that the United States doesn't need to have a command economy to reliably produce "solutions" that just make things worse,&amp;nbsp;is I start to laugh.&amp;nbsp; It's not at anyone's expense; it's just in surprise at the sudden appearance of a serious challenge that's facing all of us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part of the cause of this perception is that people of my age or younger, even in DC, seem to have a bias against talking too seriously with each other.&amp;nbsp; Yes, the college I attended trained its young people to talk &lt;i&gt;endlessly&lt;/i&gt; about &lt;i&gt;everything&lt;/i&gt;, but even in my fellow students, I saw a push towards not being a downer, towards shared frivolity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that's not bad.&amp;nbsp; It's just that now, I feel more inclined to share my laughter with people than what comes in the silence afterwards, the fumbling strategic planning of a young person who doesn't have any sources of information on the subject except these two doom-sayers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, them and &lt;a href="http://thomaspmbarnett.com/weblog/"&gt;Thomas P. Barnett&lt;/a&gt;, author of (among others) &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0399155376?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=thatbriginst-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0399155376"&gt;Great Powers: America and the World After Bush&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=thatbriginst-20&amp;amp;l=as2&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;a=0399155376" style="border: medium none ! important;

it was a very beautiful spot, and the people who lived there were as happy and friendly as you'd expect them to be.&amp;nbsp; They &lt;i&gt;liked&lt;/i&gt; their side of the mountain just fine, but the problem was that everywhere else of consequence was on the &lt;i&gt;other&lt;/i&gt; side.&amp;nbsp; That meant that whenever anyone in the village wanted to go to market, or visit relatives, or go on pilgrimage or travel for any other reason, they always had to either climb all the way over the mountain or walk all the way around it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one liked having to do this, and some people moved to other villages on the right side.&amp;nbsp; But there were still some people who stayed.&amp;nbsp; They all accepted that the mountain was where it was, and they lived where they lived, and that was just the way things were going to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They all accepted that, except for one old man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should say that he was very healthy and fit for his age.&amp;nbsp;

My answer would be that the objective judgment is its success at maintaining a continuous line of inheritance, and that it doesn't matter what I think: what lives, lives.&amp;nbsp; But, since that's a non-answer, I'd try to give an aesthetic judgment, taking my preferences as unexamined and settling on an animal or class of animals that is, on the whole, most pleasing for me to regard.&amp;nbsp; I suspect the correct answer would be "dogs."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, in much the same way, the best government is the one that gives rise to the most governments.&amp;nbsp; In the analogy, the history of a given country would be made of successive, slightly different generations, as each system gave rise to an altered form of itself (though the lines between generations would be hard to draw: changing administrations?&amp;nbsp; major laws passed?).&amp;nbsp; For example, the British colonies in North America aggregated, created a progeny, the constitutional congress, that replaced them, then gave rise to the republic, which gave rise to a slightly different republic, and so on and so forth, with a few forkings off as a given generation of America impregnated other countries (notably Japan 1945) via military, economic or social action (not that those are clearly delineated categories either).&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't have the right statistics to hazard a guess as to what forms are favored by this comparison: the CIA world factbook doesn't let me sort countries by government type.&amp;nbsp; Maybe I could write a script that would pull them in?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, as far as my personal preference, it's still tough, because Social Democracies are great, because everyone's pretty chill, and everyone's more or less taken care of.&amp;nbsp; However, it looks like the maximum enfranchisement of existing citizens leads to barriers being placed on immigration, which leads to small, insular second-class working communitees of foreigners, which naturally leads to racism: familiarity breeds familiarity, but distance fails to disprove contempt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me just say that few things will ruin my aesthetic more than tribalism (racism, xenophobia, strong cultural identity, etc).&amp;nbsp; The most appealing system, for me, would foster an absolute minimum level of clade-ishness while &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Nick</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/3246203015017924027'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/3246203015017924027'/><author><name>Nick Novitski</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08863651199447917923</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31707300.post-5502580230814747935</id><published>2008-11-12T12:27:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2008-11-12T14:42:26.365-05:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='neologism'/><title type='text'>Following is Leading</title><content type='html'>So as part of their commitment to the next-generation open social network ecosystem, Blogger has added a feature where you can "follow" other feeds.&amp;nbsp; This is much like a friends list on livejournal, except divorced from the concept of a "friend": a feed can be a person you know, or just someone you think is entertainingly crazy, or updates for software that you use, or whatever.&amp;nbsp; All updates for these feeds appear at the bottom of your blogger dashboard, much like a cramped and less useful friends page.&amp;nbsp; Luckily, they are also automatically imported to &lt;a href="http://reader.google.com/"&gt;Google Reader&lt;/a&gt; under the tag "Blogs I follow", and reader is a feed aggregating interface I find amenable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The advantage of "following" is that it can be done publicly.&amp;nbsp; Not only can I include a gadget showing my allegiances (an abbreviated list, in my case, since I follow nearly 200 feeds and blogs) but those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This latter feature currently only works for blogger users, but work it does: I can follow people, and when they see me following, they can decide whether what I say is of interest to them, and begin following me.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

But he may have been slightly more than half-joking this time, since he immediately added that I'm one year too old to join Officer Candidacy School.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's just another milestone passed on the long dark highway going nowhere, another opportunity missed, scratched off life's dance card.&amp;nbsp; So what makes it particularly poignant?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Formative decisions are much more common than we can see; only a few of them are obvious.&amp;nbsp; Military service is structured and designed to make you into something unusual and impressive.&amp;nbsp; Males all dream, at least briefly, of being badasses, and the three branches (no, not five branches: Marines are Naval personnel/ordinance and the Coast Guard, while badass in their own right, don't count as military to me) are the crystallization of the resources and efforts and expertise of more generations than I can easily imagine (they pass quicker when you're being shot at) in the form of semi-functional badass factories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't mean to lionize or deify these people, not least since that would be to simultaneously demonize them, as so many "uncivilized" societies clearly know, as Mark Twain taught me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;object height="344" width="425"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/jJsZCpp8hR4&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x006699&amp;color2=0x54abd6"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/jJsZCpp8hR4&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x006699&amp;color2=0x54abd6" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;object height="344" width="425"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/PsoJ-WJZGXM&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x006699&amp;color2=0x54abd6"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/PsoJ-WJZGXM&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x006699&amp;color2=0x54abd6" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's ask it directly:&amp;nbsp; Who prays for soldiers?&amp;nbsp; Who prays for war?&amp;nbsp; Who prays for death to come to one stranger rather than to another? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People who want to be distinguished.&amp;nbsp; Those who actually sign up frequently want to risk more than what is typically risked, because the gains seem more attractive to them, because what they have isn't so great compared to the big heap of genetic-material-delivering muscle and hoo-ah the training can turn them into.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That plus the slightly-less-long-term concerns of feeding and sheltering and deciding become things you no longer need to worry your pretty little head about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That plus, for some of them, they think that some people need to die, and that their own lives are well spent being risked on that outcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's any number of ways in which you can contribute to the future of your country.&amp;nbsp; There's any number of people who deserve thanks for what they did, just because it ensured the life we currently live rather than some other less fortunate one.&amp;nbsp; But veterans of foreign wars are &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So there are the two big reasons to serve as I see it, as I've seen it and heard it from others:&amp;nbsp;

Specifically, what makes a particular example of them "good".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I suppose that in my own taxonomy nowadays, they'd be digital fiction games with a strongly directed story and conflict synonymous with combat.&amp;nbsp; Not quite the same ring to it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More prosaically: back in the day, there was the Super Nintendo, with Secret of Mana.  Final Fantasy 3, Chrono Trigger, and others, and I drowned my young life in them.&amp;nbsp; It was their fault that I found Final Fantasy 7 to be such an intense disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The success of the NES had permanently embedded certain characters in the zeitgeist.&amp;nbsp; Mario.&amp;nbsp; Megaman.&amp;nbsp; Final Fantasy.&amp;nbsp; Each of these memetic complexes has their own associations and expectations.&amp;nbsp; Mario fights turtles.&amp;nbsp; Megaman is blue.&amp;nbsp; In Final Fantasy, a team of four heroes travels the world in order to save it in some way that involves crystals heavily (it was the 80s, and Japan was still in the practice of taking a decade to digest our cultural leavings).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Fantasy 7 was astoundingly popular.&amp;nbsp; It is one of those video games that, like Mario, was played by nearly everyone who was playing video games at the time.&amp;nbsp; This success made it genre-defining: to this day: "JRPG" effectively stands for "it's basically like Final Fantasy 7."&amp;nbsp; Everyone loved the damn thing.&amp;nbsp; I found it very disheartening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its first problem was unoriginality: it was exactly like every other game in the series, and completely failed to incorporate what seemed like the obvious innovations of Chrono Trigger, most notably the removing of suddden "Oh!&amp;nbsp; Now We Are Fighting!" random battles and the addition of characters that humans could care about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its second problem was the one innovation it could honestly claim: hideous graphics.  When I heard that the Playstation represented a new generation of graphics technology, I tried to imagine the next step in the evolution diorama.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://images.wikia.com/finalfantasy/images/6/64/Whitemage-ff1-nes.png" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"&gt;&lt;img alt="" border="0" src="http://images.wikia.com/finalfantasy/images/6/64/Whitemage-ff1-nes.png" style="cursor: pointer; display: block; height: 59px; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; width: 41px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Final Fantasy 1&lt;br /&gt;|&lt;br /&gt;|&lt;br /&gt;\/&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://images.wikia.com/finalfantasy/images/c/cc/Rosa_Farrell_battle.png" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"&gt;&lt;img alt="" border="0" src="http://images.wikia.com/finalfantasy/images/c/cc/Rosa_Farrell_battle.png" style="cursor: pointer; display: block; height: 63px; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; width: 42px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Final Fantasy 2&lt;br /&gt;|&lt;br /&gt;|&lt;br /&gt;\/&lt;a href="http://images.wikia.com/finalfantasy/images/7/75/Celes_Ch%C3%A8re_small.png" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"&gt;&lt;img alt="" border="0" src="http://images.wikia.com/finalfantasy/images/7/75/Celes_Ch%C3%A8re_small.png" style="cursor: pointer; display: block; height: 61px; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; width: 41px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Final Fantasy 3&lt;br /&gt;|&lt;br /&gt;|&lt;br /&gt;\/&lt;a href="http://images.wikia.com/finalfantasy/images/4/41/Aeris_Cloud_and_Sephiroth.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"&gt;&lt;img alt="" border="0" src="http://images.wikia.com/finalfantasy/images/4/41/Aeris_Cloud_and_Sephiroth.jpg" style="cursor: pointer; display: block; height: 201px; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; width: 335px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;GODDAMIT NO&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was appalled, disgusted.  I had grown to expect character art to be tiny works of art, ever-increasing in complexity, and instead got a series of stiff, pointy, five-color jokes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The picture above captures a moment which is widely regarded as the most pathos-ridden in the entire game, or even (according to idiots) in all games ever:  Spikyhair McFrownyface regards the stiff, lifeless (i.e. normal) form of his realdoll-knockoff lady love, while some goth chick in the background reconnects with their lord and savior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not that I played as far as this purportedly-momentous point in the game.  You can imagine, if this was supposed to be the pinnacle of Final Fantasy 7's emotive power, just how shitty the rest of it was.&amp;nbsp; You either didn't know what you were looking at, or it was ugly.&amp;nbsp; The characters were either uninteresting or unlikeable.&amp;nbsp; The music was either a fair adaptation of the same songs from the previous games, or not good.&amp;nbsp; Equal parts bland and bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won't do the plot the disservice of calling it "incomprehensible" or "nonsensical" or "complex."&amp;nbsp; Let me assure you that games with a lot of dialogue require a great deal of writing, and when those games are made to take thirty or more hours to finish, they require a stupendous amount of words to read.&amp;nbsp; &lt;i&gt;War and Peace&lt;/i&gt; is long, and many things happen to its characters over the course of that length: that makes it well-paced, not "convoluted."&amp;nbsp; On the other hand, if Pierre Bolkonsky had at regular intervals encountered characters entirely unconnnected to his story (yet each, shockingly, tailored to appeal to a specific target demographic) who nonetheless decide to accompany him for the rest of the book for ill-defined reasons...well, we might be briefly &lt;b&gt;confused&lt;/b&gt;, but it won't be because we don't &lt;b&gt;understand what is being done&lt;/b&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Final Fantasy 7 gave us a sassy underage female ninja, a mysterious emo male ninja, and a big cute cat thing.&amp;nbsp; That this trio added time to your play-through does not magically make the experience more literary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, to repeat, I was disappointed.&amp;nbsp; It wasn't what I had been hoping for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What had I been hoping for?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted visually interesting fights that got out of the way as soon as I was bored with them.&amp;nbsp; I wanted to be a hero that protected people I liked from people I didn't like.&amp;nbsp; I wanted to go to strange places that were pleasing to the eye and ear.&amp;nbsp; I wanted, on occasion, to be made to laugh and to cry, but in general, to be made interested in seeing what happened next.&amp;nbsp; Seeing.&amp;nbsp; I'm not ashamed to say that, most of all, I wanted to see pretty pictures moving around on the screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it turned out that what I wanted was Suikoden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Nick</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2008/11/suikoden-question-and-answer.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/3470077986779285781'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/3470077986779285781'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2008/11/suikoden-question-and-answer.html' title='Suikoden: Question and Answer'/><author><name>Nick Novitski</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08863651199447917923</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31707300.post-6375793877714644662</id><published>2008-11-10T23:33:00.003-05:00</published><updated>2008-11-11T13:56:02.140-05:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='suikoden'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='gaming'/><title type='text'>Suikoden: The Beginninging</title><content type='html'>There are three broadly recognized classics resting at the pinnacle of Asian literature: &lt;i&gt;The Journey West&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The Romance of the Three Kingdoms&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;The Outlaws of the Water Margin&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Journey West&lt;/i&gt; is about a monkey whom Buddha traps under a rock for not knowing sufficient restraint, and who later protects a priest and their friends on a pilgrimage to India.&amp;nbsp; It was the loose inspiration for &lt;i&gt;Dragon Ball&lt;/i&gt;, an IP with generational appeal in males aged 14-24.&amp;nbsp; &lt;i&gt;Dragon Ball &lt;/i&gt;has been a very, very long-running comic with matching television show, plus about a dozen movies, plus (most saliently) dozens and dozens of video games over the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Romance of the Three Kingdoms&lt;/i&gt; is about the lengthy conflict of the "Warring States" period of Chinese history (or rather, the history of the geographic region which is today mostly contained within the recognized sovereign territory of the People's Republic of China).&amp;nbsp; I have lost count of the number of creative works I know that are based on the events of the novel, but we can safely stick with videogames:&amp;nbsp; There's the &lt;i&gt;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&lt;/i&gt; series, games of strategy and tactics, where you choose a state and starting character, then try to trick, recruit and expand your way to dominance, and there's &lt;i&gt;Dynasty Warriors&lt;/i&gt;, where you choose a character and chop your way through teeming battlefields...to dominance.&amp;nbsp; Both franchises have had a gazillion sequels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Outlaws of the Water Margin&lt;/i&gt; (or &lt;i&gt;of the Marsh&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;of Mt. Liang&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;of Liangshan Marsh&lt;/i&gt; or even just &lt;i&gt;All Men Are Brothers&lt;/i&gt;) is about 108 demons who are accidentally released from a demon-box and incarnate as 108 dudes who have assorted amusing adventures but eventually unite into a single band of whup-assery.&amp;nbsp; Koei made the first video game to ever be based on the story, a strategic title released in America as &lt;i&gt;Bandit Kings of Ancient China&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second was a "JRPG" called &lt;i&gt;Gensou Suikoden&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both;

So yes, they got to see a watercolor crammed with awesome folks all looking out and getting ready to burst on to the world scene, including that one kid looking &lt;b&gt;right at you&lt;/b&gt; with eyes beyond his apparent years and a half-completed gesture that says "On my command, by which I mean hitting the punk holding the box upside the head so hard they'll be be pulling his teeth out of the ceiling, unleash hell, by which I mean all 108 of you look awesome &lt;b&gt;as hard as you can&lt;/b&gt;."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We did not see that.&amp;nbsp; This was still when the geniuses in marketing were convinced that "Americans" preferred their art to be less "arty" and more "shitty."&amp;nbsp; Witness Megaman, Street Fighter, Strider, and Suikoden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both;

And over the last few months I've found myself slowly moving from shaking my head at the obvious one-sided reporting, to actually shouting at the screen of my television and my laptop computer.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;But worst of all, for the last couple weeks, I've begun -- for the first time in my adult life -- to be embarrassed to admit what I do for a living. A few days ago, when asked by a new acquaintance what I did for a living, I replied that I was "a writer," because I couldn't bring myself to admit to a stranger that I'm a journalist.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What lily-livered nonsense. &amp;nbsp;Let's leave aside that everyone, reporters included, have a pro-winner bias, and Obama doesn't need to win to be every inch a winner, from his unshakeable sun-god gaze to promises of a new life, a new way of living as one family, one tribe...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, the strength of his genuine resemblance to Christ-Mithras never really occurred to me before. &amp;nbsp;No wonder he unnerves so many avowedly Christian people: they worry that the chickens have come home to roost, that rhetoric is going to be matched with action and that they're going to be tossed out of the temple like the satanic-gospel-peddling money-changers they are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hmm. &amp;nbsp;I was talking about journalism. &amp;nbsp;Yeah, let's focus on that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So leaving aside the article's obvious boo-hoo sour-grapes bias, and street-level-lionizing corner-office-demonizing bias, and, let us never forget, the corporate-sponsored bias (Did I really just link to ABC? &amp;nbsp;Will my blog ever be clean again?), all that's left is the general accusation: "A spectre is haunting the newsroom -- the spectre of bias!" &amp;nbsp;Even if this had been presented even-handedly, I would still shake my head in sorrow. &amp;nbsp;Not only is this Not News on the same level as "Professional Baseball Players Aren't Great People, Usually," or "Enforcement Doesn't Deter the Flow of Higly Demanded Goods, For Example Drugs And Cheap Labor," but it is doubly unworthy of notice, because it is using old and un-useful standards to judge the new realities of reporting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Bias, in the guise of automatic automatic personalization, is the future of news media.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, when I call it "the future," then pausing via a triumphant paragraph break and waiting for people to nod sagely (since everyone who's anyone knows how great "the future" is), reveals and fosters a bias on my part, so let me put it a better way...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Everyone wants the information they receive to be biased.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;"Woah, there! &amp;nbsp;I mean, sure, lots of other people like biased media that always reinforces and never challenges their preconceived notions, but they're all ignorant hicks/elitist know-nothings/hate-plagued terrorists/zionist quislings! &amp;nbsp;I, on the other hand, am a seeker after truth! &amp;nbsp;I want balanced reporting! &amp;nbsp;I want.."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What you want is the appearance of balance, and a feeling that you are a discerning and astute person among similarly-minded people. &amp;nbsp;You want the creators of the content tagged as "news" that you consume to be good at manufacturing this appearance and sensation. &amp;nbsp;You want them to walk you through their even-handed consideration of the bare facts. &amp;nbsp;Credit where credit's due: &amp;nbsp;you are a rationalist stalwart in the fight against the rising "feelings-focused" faux-news (Distinguishing traits: asking people "how that made you feel"). &amp;nbsp;I applaud and hope to share in your down-to-earth-edness. &amp;nbsp;But not everyone shares our preferences, so inasmuch as we want to hear from those who do and overlook those who don't, we seek bias: the sorting and limiting of information returned for a given topical query.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;"What? &amp;nbsp;That's not what bias is! &amp;nbsp;Bias is when people let their personal feelings cloud their analysis of the truth!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ah, then we are talking about different things. &amp;nbsp;What you are describing is what I would call either "inaccurate," "incomplete" or "misleading" reporting, depending on the details. &amp;nbsp;Details being somewhat annoying to keep track of, many people conflate these terms into a single word, "bias," that is used to refer to any defect of journalism other than bad spelling, especially (not always) journalism that praises things that displease you and denigrates things you admire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With sufficient discernment, the kind of "bias" you refer to can also be seen as universal: human language being what it is, there is no truly "neutral" way of presenting information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;"&gt;"What do you mean, 'human language being what it is?' &amp;nbsp;Words have known connotations, and those can "&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mean that language is inherently imprecise. &amp;nbsp;In fact, the previous sentence is full of imprecision, which partially proves my point: I know exactly what I meant, but there's all kinds of ways you can take it, depending on your particular understanding of/experiences with the words "language," "inherent," and "imprecise". &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, tThere have been far too many attempts over the years&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are doomed to failure from the start, because&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To quote James Joyce, "Other people are biased, but I am just a little set in my ways."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am equating bias with any editorial process that limits the amount of information we receive. &amp;nbsp;You may think this is 100% fine if done by people whose editing processes you are content to call "rational" or "unbiased." &amp;nbsp;For example, &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; search results are biased towards addresses with a higher page rank, which number is the result of a complex algorithm designed by people who only want you to find the best information you can want. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bias is inescapable. &amp;nbsp;Even if you were to give equal time to all information of any kind, you would be biased towards those events which people tend to report and comment on, as well as those events that affect more people, as well as those events that are spatiotemporally co-incident with human history: events of those kinds would seem to possess greater significance than otherwise, and "significance" (according to any practical meaning) is subjective, though also useful and necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, if you can offer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn't &lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;"&gt;always&lt;/span&gt; what they already believe (it depends on the person, and I personally love having my mind changed, since it makes me feel like I'm correcting and improving in some way), but it usually will be. &amp;nbsp;So the task of the journalist is to provide content, and the more powerful that content is (probably the higher the combined buying power of the customer base, but "buying power" is a stand-in here, since money is just a medium of exchange for power, the thing I wish I could measure), then the more successful a journalist they are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, part of the&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's another example of what I've taken to calling the "so-called" bias. &amp;nbsp;It's when you encounter a member of a class that you typically respect who, usually for vague and personal reasons, you don't like. &amp;nbsp;So you try to de-legitimize their membership, prefacing their title with "so-called " or "not a real." &amp;nbsp;For instance, I&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is also the first post I've written to this blog that started as a note to a shared item in Reader. &amp;nbsp;The process of converting the one to the other could stand to be much less painless, but I hope to do it more often&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Nick</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml'

Driving is relaxing, untaxing and generally fun.&amp;nbsp; So traveling on a plane, when you don't have to waste even that tiny fraction of your brain's processing power required to regulate a car's motion, must be even more relaxing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You expect me to be kidding, but it is, mostly.&amp;nbsp; I find heights above twenty feet too abstract to be frightening.&amp;nbsp; Though being six-feet-plus makes me even more generally uncomfortable on a plane than you average folks are, with every ceiling too low, with no aspect of the seat in the right place to support any of my bits what need supporting...I still go to sleep just the same.&amp;nbsp; It's just discomfort, it's just time.&amp;nbsp; Babies cry, folks cough and sneeze...but that's all normal.&amp;nbsp; I share an atmosphere with you people anywhere I go.&amp;nbsp; And in any case, I've had my cold for the year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And reaching and being in a different place, especially places that I've never been before, is always nice. &amp;nbsp;Maybe this comes from growing up in Miami, where every building, road, tree and bird seemed just so slightly inimical to human life, like we weren't supposed to stay there too long or it would be our own damn fault what happened to us. &amp;nbsp;DC is different, with folks of terrifying stability living without qualms for however long it takes, apparently waiting for this whole "federal government" fad to pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might guess that I miss California, so it's lucky that's&amp;nbsp;where I'm going! &amp;nbsp;&lt;a

/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And even if I wasn't going to someplace I knew could be fun, I would know that I'd be fine. &amp;nbsp;I have this strange tendency to not remember any place or routine except the one I am currently inside of. &amp;nbsp;Confrontation with simultaneous evidence of different epochs at the same time (say, when I leave work on Friday and go to visit the college campus in Annapolis) makes me queasy; maybe it's a function of my generally poor memory, maybe I just want changes to stay changed, so my bizarre fluidity remains an advantage, but either way, I get the opposite of homesickness, which is what the word "homesickness" should actually mean anyway. &amp;nbsp;If I start &amp;nbsp;talking about "milksickness" or "bonesickness," you don't think that I am longing for those things, you think they have some kind of problem and I need to either avoid them or fix them! &amp;nbsp;And what's with all this looking back in the first place? &amp;nbsp;The future, the things that come next, those things are awesome, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That those words are a half-lie, coming from me, might be why every night before I travel farther than an hour and a half, I get so nervous I can't sleep. &amp;nbsp;I might punch and kick things, throw stuff around with strangled shouts. &amp;nbsp;I might suddenly decide to take back up running, and leave at 10 to come back at midnight. &amp;nbsp;I might decide to start driving, just pick a road and keep going until either it runs out, or I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't really know why this happens, but maybe it's because I am instinctively afraid of some potential loss. &amp;nbsp;It's so easy for me to become someone else somewhere else that whoever I am before I leave senses his death approaching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We all die gradually, again and again, until we stop. &amp;nbsp;Each day a slightly different person wakes up in our bed than did the day before (meaning ourselves, and not counting other reasons for multiple folks passing through our beds, but if the distinction is necessary, then more power to you) until no one wakes up at all. &amp;nbsp;I guess more solid personalities are selected for on one level: if one mode of being is more likely to persist, then it's more likely for more folks to be in that mode at any given time. &amp;nbsp;I like to think that there are advantages to this flexibility, this identi-facility, but it's obvious that's only because I'm stuck with it. &amp;nbsp;Permanence has its appeal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm glad to have company on this particular night before. &amp;nbsp;It helps a small bit; at least I'm not at great risk of hurting myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Nick</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html'

will only be available for you to click through, page after awful (meaning great) page, chapter after existentially revolting (meaning incredible) chapter for one more week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mean, sure, you could buy the book, the way I am going to, even though I have read the whole thing.&amp;nbsp; But then you might not be able to sit in your darkened room, lit only by lines of laconic text, punctuated by pictures of completely innocent things that may make you want to scream until you vomit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mean, the thing about scary books, as distinct from scary movies (and that pretty much covers the range of horrific mediums, besides hay rides and wax museums) is that they can't just jump out and booga-booga you, right?&amp;nbsp; They have to make you believe that you yourself are in danger from the threats present or implied in the text.&amp;nbsp; I've seen this done in two ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The danger is so thoroughly described, it's as if you're experiencing it.&amp;nbsp; It's just like how sufficiently convincing images on the movie screen can frighten us even when we know they aren't tangible.&amp;nbsp; We comprehend them on an instinctive enough level that we can have instinctive responses. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The danger is convincingly framed as something that genuinely menaces we the readers, as something that might have already touched our lives, or might someday, or is RIGHT BEHIND US OH GOD&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost every Lovecraft story involves some awful revelation, a brief peek at something odd that allows the narrator to really get it, to realize that there are intelligent non-human entities that live in the ocean, or that asiatics and negroes are due to inherit the earth, or something equally "scary" (PS: Lovecraft was racist to the point of caricature).&amp;nbsp; And it's supposed to be "scary" to us, because it's being presented as an account delivered by the guy who saw it.&amp;nbsp; "You don't realize this," he says, "because it's hidden from us.&amp;nbsp; But by chance, I was able to see it.&amp;nbsp; Now you and I both know.&amp;nbsp; Oh dear.&amp;nbsp; *takes more laudanum*"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;David, the pseudonymous narrator of John Dies at the End, does not take laudanum.&amp;nbsp; David drinks beer.&amp;nbsp; David's not confident enough in his command of english to make you live in his shoes.&amp;nbsp; He just wants to tell you about this stuff that happened to him and his friend John in their home town of Undisclosed.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stephen King sets almost all of his stories in Maine, because Stephen King lives in Maine, and his eyesight is far too poor to glean useful information about any other state, even nearby ones.&amp;nbsp; Maine is not frightening, except in as much as Stephen King lives there and is still allowed to drive, despite having killed any number of people.&amp;nbsp; Undisclosed is frightening.&amp;nbsp; Undisclosed is in the rust belt.&amp;nbsp; Undisclosed teeters on the edge of the end of western civilization, as the dehumanized, poison-spewing pain train hurtles off it's screeching rails into a hole a mile wide, shaped like a smile, from which faint screaming can be heard.&amp;nbsp; Undisclosed is very frightening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;David has lived there all his life.&amp;nbsp; David is not good at talking about his feelings, so you don't get a lot of ooh-ing and ah-ing at his intense existential anxiety.&amp;nbsp; He usually talks around it, because he doesn't want to sound like a pansy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like David, and I like John.&amp;nbsp; You might also.&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href="http://www.johndiesattheend.com/1-1.html"&gt;Read it now&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Nick</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2008/09/now-hear-this.html#comment-form' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/5601383648374547410'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/5601383648374547410'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2008/09/now-hear-this.html' title='Now Hear This'/><author><name>Nick Novitski</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08863651199447917923</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31707300.post-8600262091166573121</id><published>2008-09-18T15:50:00.002-04:00</published><updated>2009-06-01T22:24:20.258-04:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='then I had some toast'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='neologism'/><title type='text'>Overheard at work: copyright debates</title><content type='html'>Less overheard than over-read in the notes on a given ticket. &amp;nbsp;The exchange went something like this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Customer: Hey, thanks for those business cards files you made for us. &amp;nbsp;They're great. &amp;nbsp;But we'd like to be able to edit them. &amp;nbsp;Right now they're PDFs, so there's apparently no way to change them? &amp;nbsp;Anyway, make them something else that we can edit however we want.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Us: Yeah, you can't edit PDFs unless you buy the right software from Adobe. &amp;nbsp;So you can do that, or, if it's something small you want changed, you can tell us, and we'll bill the work at our usual rate.

Designers put in place to keep those people from abusing loopholes. After all, this is a roleplaying game. Loopholes exist. So, instead of putting so many limits on the players that they can’t even breathe, I’ve done the opposite. I’ve put the power directly into your hands. Again, you may ask, why would I do such a thing?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I trust you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I trust that you understand it isn’t just the Narrator’s job to make sure everybody’s having fun. It’s &lt;i&gt;everybody’s&lt;/i&gt; job to make sure everybody is having fun. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was John Wick, creator of the roleplaying games &lt;i&gt;Legend of the Five Rings&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;7th Sea&lt;/i&gt;, from the "Players" chapter of his brand new roleplaying game, &lt;i&gt;Houses of the Blooded&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; So now that you've met him, maybe now you understand me when I say that, when John Wick tells you that for a limited time only, you can &lt;a href="http://wickedthought.livejournal.com/777693.html"&gt;get the pdf of his brand new roleplaying game&lt;i&gt;, Houses of the Blooded&lt;/i&gt;, for only five stinkin' bucks&lt;/a&gt;, then you don't think about it, you &lt;a href="http://www.indiepressrevolution.com/xcart/product.php?productid=16617"&gt;buy the damn thing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And by you, I mean "I and maybe you too."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From my skimming once-over, it's excellent.&amp;nbsp; It's &lt;i&gt;Vampire&lt;/i&gt; meets &lt;i&gt;Birthright&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Or at least, it's the meeting of what I wanted those games to be.&amp;nbsp; Rules for personal passion and tragedy, rules for managing and expanding your holdings.&amp;nbsp; I deem it to be "the hype."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The core innovation on top of the Fate system is the concept of "wagers."&amp;nbsp; Simply:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Get dice (6-sided) from one stat and some aspects.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Choose how many of those dice you roll, and how many you instead "wager".&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sum results of rolled dice.&amp;nbsp; Greater than 10 is "success".&amp;nbsp; Say how you do or do not accomplish (your choice) what was being tested.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you succeeded, state one more fact about the action for each wager you made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;Basically, the camera rests on characters when they are doing what they are good at.&amp;nbsp; Also, it explicitly turns "Gather Information" rolls into "Establish as Fact Whatever You Think Would Be Advantageous or Cool" rolls.&amp;nbsp; Awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No list of skills means ability in a given field (there are six) is broadly applicable, so characters (presumably) feel extremely capable.&amp;nbsp; But they also have a weakness, which is nearly absolute; you receive no dice in one of the six kinds of rolls.&amp;nbsp; Other games talk about "tragic flaws," but this one cuts a hole in your armor and rings the dinner bell for your enemies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet another game to file under "Would Like to Play Sometime."&amp;nbsp; Sigh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Nick</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2008/09/houses-of-blooded-sale-and-first.html#comment-form' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/462431099956757079'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/462431099956757079'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2008/09/houses-of-blooded-sale-and-first.html' title='Houses of the Blooded Sale and First Impressions'/><author><name>Nick Novitski</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08863651199447917923</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31707300.post-1878013823754951404</id><published>2008-08-29T14:07:00.002-04:00</published><updated>2009-03-02T22:23:00.867-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='gaming'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='neologism'/><title type='text'>Homes for Heroes</title><content type='html'>&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;City of Heroes&lt;/span&gt; is a game I played once.  If you aren't familiar, it's World of Warcraft, but you're a superhero in (I swear) an alternate universe Rhode Island.  It was fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is, to put it mildly, well-supported.  Besides the usual problem fixes, the designers regularly release Issues: large packs of entirely new quests, events, and game concepts.  You'd log in and now your hero could have a cape, or wings, or a hideout.  Gadgets were introduced as a new kind of power-up item.  Entirely new sets of powers for your superheros to use were created.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today &lt;a href="http://reader.google.com/"&gt;Reader&lt;/a&gt; brought my attention to &lt;a href="http://www.cityofheroes.com/game_update13.html"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; on the game's upcoming 13th issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, I had heard about it before.  Specifically, I had heard that this patch will allow players to create missions, quests, for other players.  I think that's a feature that will go from "No game does it except for that one weird one" to "every game has that in some form unless they suck" in record time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what I hadn't heard of was this secret identity stuff.  Good grief.  It is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) An absolutely brilliant way for a game to support the the conventions of the genre.  "Now that I've fought crime, I've got to get back to the Local Newspaper offices before anyone notices I'm gone!"&lt;br /&gt;2) Yet another feature that no one else thought of and will soon become standard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long before "user-generated content" was a buzzword, it was a simple fact.  &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Ultima Online &lt;/span&gt;had a persistent game world where the players could own land and build houses.  This didn't seem revolutionary at the time.  In fact, &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;UO&lt;/span&gt;'s property system &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;was extremely limited compared to that of almost any text-based MUD you'd care to look at.  People who played these things expected to be able to have houses.  Otherwise, they'd be homeless!  How terrible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yet nowadays, good 3-d art assets being so terribly time consuming to make, not many games let players own and customize property in-game.  All those gorgeously kitted-out warriors of the Alliance, veterans of every great conflict in Azeroth?  Homeless.  Destitute veterans wearing and carrying immense fortunes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I admit that this bothers me.  Armor and weapons and history make you a wandering ex-soldier.  Property, renown, &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;effect on the game world&lt;/span&gt;, these things make you powerful.  Or at least feel powerful in a virtual context.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Fantasy 11&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Granado Espada&lt;/span&gt; and, as I understand it, &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;City of Heroes&lt;/span&gt;, use a system where an instance is created that claims to be, respectively, your imaginary apartment, family mansion, and hideout.  But no one can encounter these places in the normal course of play: They're abstracted out.  No one can go there except you and people you invite, meaning no one can discover it, no one can encounter it, just as they encounter Horn Mountain or the Well of Souls or all the other locations of the shared fiction.  No one is talking about that cool place where you live.  But despite this fugue-state-esque privacy, there's nothing unique or special about your home: They all occupy the same basic imagined location in the game world, since the entrances to these spaces are the same for everyone.  Everyone's apartment is down that street.  Everyone's mansion is behind these gates.  (I don't know if the Hideouts in &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;City of Heroes&lt;/span&gt; are guilty of this too.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This change means that your hero doesn't have to disappear just because you stop playing.  You can know where he is.  He builds a connection to a place that anyone can see, where everyone walks past.  He binds himself to the fabric of the fiction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Super-cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Nick</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2008/08/homes-for-heroes.html#comment-form' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/1878013823754951404'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/1878013823754951404'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2008/08/homes-for-heroes.html' title='Homes for Heroes'/><author><name>Nick Novitski</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08863651199447917923</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31707300.post-7480897221824591052</id><published>2008-08-28T22:11:00.006-04:00</published><updated>2009-03-02T22:22:01.410-05:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='actual play'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='gaming'/><title type='text'>The Story of the Four Friends who told Three Stories</title><content type='html'>So I've bought Meg Baker's 1001 Nights, and since played two games with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me to say "It's great!" is a lot like someone else saying "It's legible!"&amp;nbsp;

So far, I only have two data points on which to base that prediction - this delicately yet fiercely arranged period/suspense/mystery story, and &lt;i&gt;The Club Dumas&lt;/i&gt; - but they have enough in common (to my pleasure) that I feel I have basis for hope.&amp;nbsp; Both feature a protagonist defined by being capable in some ways and incapable in others.&amp;nbsp; These latter, more constraining ways showcase that fear (universal?&amp;nbsp; just me?) that the die is cast now and forever, that there will never be, for us, anything more than what there is right now, and the dingiest fading echo of arbitrary used-to-bes.&amp;nbsp; The protagonists faces this horror, shaking, and then does what holds to his ethics anyway.&amp;nbsp; This makes him awesome, even though there is no one around to see it, besides us, the reader.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Klingon's say that the stars see what we do, and remember.&amp;nbsp; That certainly ranks among the best fantasies: "What I have done is known, and I am understood."&amp;nbsp; There's certainly nothing (feasible) that I want more fiercely.&amp;nbsp; But the heroes of these books prosecute their moralities (both of which are mistaken by those around them as a kind of affected lack-of-morality) even in the face of ignominy, and annihilation.&amp;nbsp; When I admire this, am I taking into account that I am acting as a star to them, as their judge on the Last Day?&amp;nbsp; God, Augustine and others have pointed out, perceives our lives not unlike the way we perceive a book, with each page existing equally, not distinguished by the properties "now," "past" or "to come," with the whole course of a life seen entirely, all connections made, a book that is also a diamond that is also a thought.&amp;nbsp; So that's us, when we read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So anyway, there's no telling how much the other books will follow this pattern, but it's a good sign.&amp;nbsp; Just like, anyone who enjoys Umberto Eco's first book will find it very hard to hate any of them.&amp;nbsp; But then, maybe that's just because he started writing late in life?&amp;nbsp; He was fixed in his ways?&amp;nbsp; Leaving a testament rather than exploring new modes of being?&amp;nbsp; &lt;i&gt;The Mysterious Flame&lt;/i&gt; certainly reads like an epitaph...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that, besides his beautiful and moving books that have changed my life, the other reason Umberto Eco is precious to me is that he didn't start writing award-winning world-famous fiction until his advanced years.&amp;nbsp; I like to think that sometime in the course of my life, a pill will be invented that will grant me the focus that I've never been able to marshal effectively, and I'll be able to write everything that I have ever thought which I still think is worth disseminating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, more Perez-Reverte is to be put into my schedule.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Anna Karenina&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My faculty advisor for my senior essay on &lt;i&gt;War &amp;amp; Peace&lt;/i&gt; asked me to read this and tell him what I thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, he wanted to know whether I thought it or &lt;i&gt;War &amp;amp; Peace&lt;/i&gt; was "better."&amp;nbsp; Apparently, this is what literary folk talk about.&amp;nbsp; I would respond by saying that they're different things.&amp;nbsp; &lt;i&gt;War &amp;amp; Peace&lt;/i&gt; didn't seem as much like a novel: it was more "about" broader subjects - our place in the universe, the way we grow and develop, war, peace, etc - than "about" individual people.&amp;nbsp; The principle characters in &lt;i&gt;Karenina&lt;/i&gt; seem distinct, not standing in for archetypes (as much).&amp;nbsp; Here are these people.&amp;nbsp; Here are the things they do.&amp;nbsp; Here is a section of their mere lives.&amp;nbsp; Of course, both works are nearly unequalled in the degree to which they convincingly portray those lives.&amp;nbsp; Your annoyances (and don't worry, you will have them, you 21st-century free-thinker, you) will be directed at the characters, as if they were real people, rather than at the book or author, for being obtuse or parochial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though I am annoyed at him dropping the ball on universality.&amp;nbsp; "Wait a minute, isn't my moral-philosophical revelation accessible to all people, even if they were ignorant of my religion?...ahh, who knows.&amp;nbsp; Moving on!"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it's at least as difficult to understand biologically different folks than it is to understand culturally different folks.&amp;nbsp; The sensitivity and deftness Tolstoi exhibits when portraying women (which he was also not one of) didn't go so far as "the Turk?"&amp;nbsp; Or really, that such a clear and beautiful mind would have not have questioned whether the trappings of his church was the &lt;i&gt;source&lt;/i&gt; of his morality, or just happened to &lt;i&gt;sit well &lt;/i&gt;with his morality?&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, it's beautiful, and sobering.&amp;nbsp; A morality play, though it convinced me less about the dangers of (spoilers!) adultery, and more about the dangers of taking yourself too seriously and of psychically tearing yourself apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Al Qur'an&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's beautiful, and more engaging on average than the Torah or Bible so far, and full of amusing quotes I think I'm going to try to collect.&amp;nbsp; Plus, I revel in the thought of shocking people who notice what I'm reading.&amp;nbsp; But of course, no one's actually said anything, except the one person who asked if I finished &lt;i&gt;Anna Karenina&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Nick</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2008/08/summer-reading.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/8643810033863902146'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/8643810033863902146'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2008/08/summer-reading.html' title='Summer Reading'/><author><name>Nick Novitski</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08863651199447917923</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31707300.post-864529131865076184</id><published>2008-08-01T10:00:00.004-04:00</published><updated>2009-06-01T22:24:20.260-04:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='then I had some toast'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='music'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='dc'/><title type='text'>The Fun Report</title><content type='html'>In which I list things that I would like to spend money on this weekend (and their venues), but then speak of them as if they were dead to me, in an effort to be fiscally responsible to my future selves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;They Live&lt;/i&gt;, AFI Silver&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the invention of the fight sequence, there have been five that were known to be the most passionate, the most pure.  The central (though hardly pivotal or climactic) fight sequence in &lt;i&gt;They Live&lt;/i&gt; does not leave them all behind, but it makes the list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is hardly it's only accomplishment.  Almost anyone who has gone to a movie with me has heard me complain about over-exposition.  &lt;i&gt;They Live&lt;/i&gt; is an ironic breath of fresh air, starring a homeless Roddy Piper (known as "the Rowdy) who has no friends (until he beats up Louis Gosset Jr, the aforesaid fight sequence the awesomeness of which you cannot understand from mere description); he has no one to talk to when he starts seeing things through an abandoned pair of shades that he doesn't want to believe might be real.  There's no voice over.  There's no text crawl.  You see what he does and you figure it out for yourself.  It's the model of what movies should be like nowadays: brave enough to admit they aren't so complicated that anyone with $10 in their pocket on Friday night will be able to understand what's happening just fine, even without any hand-holding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since moving to Silver Spring, I swore that I would take advantage of the AFI Theatre's awesome selection and non-stop festivaling...some day.  But that that day is not this weekend.  Oh well!  Plenty of movies in the world, and I can't see them all!  Maybe I could finally polish off the last season of &lt;i&gt;Due South&lt;/i&gt; instead!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gnarls Barkley, 9:30 Club&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Man are they amazing.  Like, not just a little.  Cee-lo has a positively Orphic voice, and Danger Mouse aapparently fell through a portal from the cartoon universe of the Gorillaz as a child, and is trying to merge our plane with his homeland by making infectious tunes that are prayers in a language only he knows, and whose collective turning through our helplessly addicted minds will eventually build up enough power to subduct all or most of what we consider real beneath the mass of a world where "genre" is a word unknown to even the wise, and all movement is done to rythym and called music.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The failure of my metaphor does nothing to decrease the potency of these people.  Folks talk about &lt;i&gt;Crazy&lt;/i&gt; being their one wond'rous hit, but I have yet to hear the song of theirs that didn't leave me entirely hypnotized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Say, I already own one album of theirs!  I should just spin it up in my own pre-bought cd player!  With some carrots and apple juice, I'll have a concert of my own, from the comfort of home!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brian Posehn, Arlington Cinema n' Drafthouse.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be sure, the name alone guarantees I must visit &lt;a href="http://www.arlingtondrafthouse.com/"&gt;that establishment&lt;/a&gt; eventually (or maybe wait until &lt;a href="http://www.arlingtondrafthouse.com/montgomery.aspx"&gt;the one in my area&lt;/a&gt; opens).  But when I do, it will be a shame that Mr. Posehn won't be there.  Stale off the successfully named "Comedians of Comedy" tour, with appearances as one of the nerdy but happily gay-married neighbors on the Sarah Silverman Program, and as that guy who dies right away in The Devil's Rejects, and a bunch of other stuff so you'd totally recognize him if you saw him, though my attempts to describe him as "Big, hairy, red, with glasses and a head like a boiled egg that came out wrong" will prove fruitless.  Will he play tracks from his metal band's only album, &lt;a href="http://www.seeqpod.net/search/?plid=3c03d02c96"&gt;Nerd Rage&lt;/a&gt;?  One can only hope and dream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hey, maybe I can find some tracks of his online!  That'll be like going, but free from the slight yet pervasive fear I always have that live comedians will incorporate me into their performances to my discomfort and embarrasment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Southern Culture on the Skids, 9:30 Club&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Funny story!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So there I was, sometime in upper-middle school, reading this comic.  And by "read," I really mean "look at," because it was all in japanese and whatever.  And by "comic" I mean "sequential pornographic art."  Not being able to understand the dialogue, my understanding of the events was something like this:  There was this girl in a beret, moping around in an Anna Millers-type of restaurant.  That is, it's just like any other theme restaurant where the theme is "we demean the young women who need a job badly enough to work here by making them sell their fake interest and the nearness of their nubile flesh to the losers of the world," except when we objectify our ladies, it's usually with them wearing simple and nearly absent clothing.  But Anna Millers, they wear crypto-victorian maid and young-mistress-Alice outfits (also, they sell pancakes rather than hot wings, but who cares).  Tight, short-skirted, revealing in a way, but I never quite understood the allure.  It always reminds me of the Ferengi, the giant-eared money-grubbers from Deep Space Nine, who, it was said, invariably fantasized about wrapping the objects of their yellow-toothed, bulbous-forheaded affections in thick, opaque guaze.  To what end even the fevered imaginations of Star Trek Novel Fandom has been yet to guess, and if they do, I never want to hear about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this lady is moping in this restaurant, which I have to say outfits it's waitresses in a much racier way than the average Anna Millers-a-like.  Why there?  Because she too likes the girls in their pleated skirts and cheerily submissive dispositions.  She clearly longs after them, one in particular.  She wastes hours here, buying milkshake after milkshake, watching the waitresses flounce too and fro (especially fro), answering meekly whenever they ask her if there's anything else she'd like, then cursing her own shyness and unattainable passions in the staircase moments afterward.  So, it's a no-brainer: she's some loser guy who happened to be born a slim, attractive brunette.  After god knows how many months of this, the "Master" of the place sits down sits down in our heroine's booth.  The Master of an establishment is basically a bartender, except he can exist independantly of the bar, and both speaks and dresses in a way calculated to inject some Old World sophistication and foppery into the atmosphere.  As is usual in the fiction, this one is female.  Tall, with short blonde hair and an indolent smirk, she apparently sees right though to the lady-tagonist's perverted core, but rather than come out and say it, she drops a blush-inducing hint or three, then offers her a job at the place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A dream come true, and obviously one that leads to assorted health-code violating hijinks, but that's not what I'm talking about today.  The point is this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lady goes home, bites the bullet, and starts to get ready for her on-the-job training.  And as we're treated to a relatively tasteful montage of her losing the baseball cap and sweatshirt, and getting dressed in her new demeaning/empowering Lewis Carrol-esque duds, and our (my) excitement is finally starting to build, or at least break ground, when all of a sudden, off to one side of the panel, context-free, english as life, it says: "Playlist: &lt;a href="http://www.seeqpod.net/search/?plid=f62ca2173e"&gt;Southern Culture on the Skids - &lt;i&gt;Pass the Hatchet&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And you know what?  That comic was &lt;i&gt;right&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, their live shows are apparently really crazy, throwing buckets of KFC into the audience and what-have-you.  It'll be a shame to miss them.  Oh well!  It will probably be more fulfilling in the long run to spend that time reading the Qur'an!  Especially the parts about not abusing yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Coldplay, Verizon Center&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't know why I feel the need to apologize for this one.  A terrible stigma hangs on those who like what other people like, I suppose, and yet the curse isn't powerful enough to keep me from plundering the tomb of these faux-akward londonites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have this problem, perhaps from watching too many music videos, where songs give me over-specific visions of the stories that could be told to their tune.  Coldplay is strong in this particular force, so I make them a member of the Jedi Council of my heart, and enjoy every song like its a trailer for a movie I'd love to see if it was real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example, though &lt;a href="http://www.seeqpod.net/search/?plid=fef92bb330"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Clocks&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is classic over-played hipster pop, it's the &lt;i&gt;Sail Away&lt;/i&gt; to my Cartman: if I hear even one small part of it, I can't help but listen to the whole thing.  Why should I apologize for a graceful melodic race across the tops of the brightly lit red roofs, my heart racing while my mind stands still, leaping, crashing into the water, wishing it was you?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of roofs, what's up with &lt;a href="http://www.seeqpod.net/search/?plid=8f023e474d"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cemetaries of London&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; talking about the "skies over london?"  We're what's up, that's what.  To the dead in their pine and marble, we walk in the sky, living in clouds of concrete and soot and the pain we inflict on eachother.  Uncare bears.  In any city of appreciable age the dead vastly outnumber the living, making their spaces the true spaces and ours the margins, much less in &lt;i&gt;Luandun&lt;/i&gt;, "fortress of the moon," where Diana waxes and the ghosts gain substance and grime, until the most sensitive among us can feel diaphanous, fragile, wisps of wistful reels sung under a million breaths, barely heard among the teeming billions of dead. Where we are right now is heaven, and our sad, tired work, the work of angels.  Most who live don't know this truth, but you can hear it, if you carouse hard enough, in the pattern of pulses behind your eyes after you've been up and out long enough to become sober again in mystic proportion to the sun's rising, piecing yourself together in the gutter like Osiris and Isis, Enki and Inanna, John and Yoko, joined mystically in one, the &lt;i&gt;Chymical Hangover of Christian Rosenkreutz&lt;/i&gt;, and you look at the sun and it hurts but you aren't quite yourself enough yet to know to look away and then you&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;become&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's what I see/hear in it, anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I bet the concert would have been loud full of annoying white people and I wouldn't have been able to make out the words.  I should play Guitar Hero instead!  It's mildly challenging demands on my motor control serve to enhance the pleasure of hearing music with a spice of illusory control!

This work is of surprising variety, as the customers have all kinds of needs and set-ups.  It seems like there's always something new to learn and do, except when there isn't.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's regulated without being regimented; our system for automatically tracking client requests and projects also tracks the time we claim that we spent on them, with the goal being all fourty hours of your week being accounted for.&amp;nbsp; But that's hardly a burden when surroundings are comfortable, co-workers are welcoming, and work is diverting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In general, it's all that I deserve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Nick</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html'

reminded me of several ideas I had a while back (but, I freely admit, that I had no way of implementing, and it weren't nearly as generally cool as Wave, so please don't think I'm trying to claim any kind of injury here).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's also made me very sad that I wasn't able to go to Google I/O this year. &amp;nbsp;Here's the keynote that introduced it. &amp;nbsp;Imagine my jaw

you have time to watch it. &amp;nbsp;Personally, I think that it's worth it. &amp;nbsp;Feel free to not pay attention during the brief technical delays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So like I was saying, these ideas...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I post on this blog very sporadically. &amp;nbsp;I find it rare that I summon the energy to put together a post that I'm confident I can show to the world without concern. &amp;nbsp;I try to be careful and thorough and useful and unembarrasing (or at least, inoffensive). &amp;nbsp;In fact, I try to only publicly post things that I could accept being read by everyone in the entire world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a fairly high barrier, so my infrequency should be no surprise. &amp;nbsp;But contrast this with the fact that, thanks to Reader, I'm able to follow a great many blogs and websites, which regularly allows me to make some small contribution to the discussions started by others. &amp;nbsp;Many of the bloggers whom I follow, out of interest in their opinions and activities also follow other folks' blogs, and comment on them, and some of them also participate in forums, but I'm only ever aware of the one&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;used to

scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='school'/><title type='text'>Birthday</title><content type='html'>Today I complete my twenty-sixth year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My birthday has always fallen near the end of the school year, which is usually less-than optimal: People are distracted by a host of concerns, real or imagined.  Camps, trips, flights, drives, hikes, bikes, vacations and visitations.  Jobs, work, service, practice, classes and college.  Plus, of course, parties, parties, parties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for me, this is the year that college ends.  Most of my classmates are planning to get further schooling, feeling (I can't imagine why) that they are not prepared for their career of choice.  But some face the real world for the first time.  They feel a more intense set of concerns now than perhaps they did in past years.  So it's more forgivable this year than ever before, and it's always been forgivable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notable events of the past year:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Became a college senior.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Was in a college play.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Attended my sister's wedding.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wrote software for the Jane Goodall Institute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Founded a school club.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Made friends, lost friends, avoided watching &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Friends&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stopped playing World of Warcraft, started playing World of Warcraft, applied for job working for people who make World of Warcraft.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Planned events for the coming year:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Graduate from college.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Move to...somewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Provide for my own livelihood.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Practice writing, composition, and design, LAMP, a host of scripting and programming languages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make a portfolio.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Proselytize gaming more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;It's a short list.  Minimizing expectations is a talisman against failure, but if you're reduced to making talismans, you're already afraid.  We shouldn't live in fear, shouldn't let it shape our decisions, should accept the charge of prideful gladly if it would give us the chance to briefly rise above the dirt from which we are composed...but our strength is sporadic.  Fear lives in us, at the base of the skull, the spine, the tender trembling joints of the fingers.  It spreads out from the infection points unnoticed until we suddenly notice our parts failing to respond, and fall to our knees, or else the fear leaps up in a cold wave to batter and drown that union of parts which we want to call "me."  However we beat back that salt tide, it retreats to lurk in those unassailable redoubts.  It can't be destroyed except by destroying them, which many people find the courage to do, but after which they had, as it were, nothing further to say on the matter.  "To not live in fear" is oxymoronic.  Non-vegetable life only lives because of its fear, its retrograde reaction to things which will negatively impact its survival.  Fear must remain, at least for those things which must be feared, and so other things are tainted by it and we feel fear for them as well.  Someday there may be made beings who don't fear anything except what they really should, but until then, I remain alarmed by the dark, bugs, and failure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any yet, let it be said: Though when I graduated high school, fear drove me to not attend St. Johns, I came back, and I will leave on my own power.  Our strength is sporadic, but that cuts both ways.   Sometimes we are strong, and I ask no more than "sometimes" from life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Nick</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2008/04/birthday.html#comment-form' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/2275092058619773596'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/2275092058619773596'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2008/04/birthday.html' title='Birthday'/><author><name>Nick Novitski</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08863651199447917923</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31707300.post-293631746638915983</id><published>2008-04-14T00:00:00.006-04:00</published><updated>2008-08-23T08:08:32.565-04:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ethics'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='history'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='politics'/><title type='text'>Yesterday/Today</title><content type='html'>&lt;span style="font-size: 180%;"&gt;Mourning/Remembrance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fellow-citizens, the fourteenth day of April, 1865, of which this is the eleventh anniversary, is now and will ever remain a memorable day in the annals of this Republic.  It was on the evening of this day, while a fierce and sanguinary rebellion was in the last stages of its desolating power; while its armies were broken and scattered before the invincible armies of Grant and Sherman; while a great nation, torn and rent by war, was already beginning to raise to the skies loud anthems of joy at the dawn of peace, it was startled, amazed, and overwhelmed by the crowning crime of slavery - the assassination of Abraham Lincoln.  It was a new crime, a pure act of malice.  No purpose of the rebellion was to be served by it.  It was the simple gratification of a hell-black spirit of revenge.  But it has done good after all.  It has filled the country with a deeper abhorrence of slavery and a deeper love for the great liberator.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Had Abraham Lincoln died from any of the numerous ills to which flesh is heir; had he reached that good old age of which his vigorous constitution and his temperate habits gave promise; had he  been permitted to see the end of his great work; had the solemn curtain of death come down but gradually - we should still have been smitten with a heavy grief, and treasured his name lovingly.  But dying as he did die, by the red hand of violence, killed, assassinated, taken off without warning, not because of personal hate - for no man who knew Abraham Lincoln could hate him - but because of his fidelity to union and liberty, he is doubly dear to us, and his memory will be precious forever.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fellow-citizens, I end, as I began, with congratulations.  We have done a good work for our race today.  In doing honor to the memory of our friend and liberator, we have been doing highest honors to ourselves and those who come after us; we have been fastening ourselves to a name and fame imperishable and immortal; we have also been defending ourselves from a blighting scandal.  When now it shall be said that the colored man is soulless, that he has no appreciation of the benefits or benefactors; when the foul reproach of ingratitude is hurled at us, and it is attempted to scourge us beyond the range of human brotherhood, we may calmly point to the monument we have this day erected to the memory of Abraham Lincoln.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: right;"&gt;Frederick Douglass, Oration in Memory of Abraham Lincoln&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 180%;"&gt;Hope/Fear&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;There is no defense or security for any of us except in the highest intelligence and development of all.  If anywhere there are efforts tending to curtail the fullest growth of the Negro, let these efforts be turned into stimulating, encouraging, and making him the most useful and intelligent citizen.  Effort or means so invested will pay a thousand per cent interest.  These efforts will be twice blessed - "blessing him that gives and him that takes."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;There is no escape through the law of man or God from the inevitable: -&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;The laws of changeless justice bind&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Oppressor with oppressed;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;And close as sin and suffering joined&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;We march to fate abreast.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nearly sixteen millions of hands will aid you in pulling the load upward, or they will pull against you the load downward.  We shall constitute one-third and more of the ignorance and crime of the South, or one-third its intelligence and progress; we shall contribute one-third to the business and industrial prosperity of the South, or we shall prove a veritable body of death, stagnating, depressing, retarding every effort to advance the body politic.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: right;"&gt;Booker T.

They swung open as we approached, but we still had to cross the opulent, incongruously well-kept period antechamber to reach the outer doors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clock chimed, the bells tolled, the doors would not open.  I allowed myself only a moments regret.  I cast the three greatest treasures I had found on this trip (only the latest of many, but the first which had ended this way, though I of course knew the risks) to the floor in front of me, and I adopted a suitably humble posture from which I might hope to beg for my life.  I urged you to do the same.

Specifically, I think that &lt;a href="http://inform-fiction.org/I7/Welcome.html"&gt;Inform 7&lt;/a&gt; would let me develop both logic and prose skills, prototype rapidly, publish to every platform simultaneously, etc.  All that was lacking was an idea, which I think I now have the roots of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What does this title tell us?  "Soldier" means there's some kind of war or conflict, either raging or incipient.  It also means that the rest of the title refers to the character that the player controls, since there has never been a game with "soldier" in the title where this was not the case.  That means that it is he that is "dwarven," and not his enemies or allies.  Distinctly dwarven activities include DIGGING and FORGING.  Perhaps exploring the mineral deposits on a "moon?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Metroid meets Dwarf Fortress via Interactive Fiction: You explore an alien world alone, tunneling through different areas and extending your capacities by expanding your home and holdings with devices or rooms you yourself build.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Undoubtedly, there was a disaster during landing. Disastrous crash landings into lonely areas are one of the great cliches of Interactive Fiction, but there's a reason for that: You don't have to model more than a handful of NPCs or interesting objects, you can scatter them around the planet, and you can immediately give the player a motive for exploring and collecting things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm amazed at how many ideas got kicked off by a silly name generating page.  There's a lesson here about creativity flowing from the no-mans-land between the blank page and the completed novel, but I'm too busy with vacationing to write about it now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Nick</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2008/03/my-first-if-project.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/7588455770120216298'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/7588455770120216298'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2008/03/my-first-if-project.html' title='My First IF Project'/><author><name>Nick Novitski</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08863651199447917923</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31707300.post-6560322342386588636</id><published>2008-03-03T15:20:00.001-05:00</published><updated>2008-04-02T21:25:45.593-04:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>A Justification for Self-Publishing</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I found this somewhere.

Sitting in front of a screen just "isn't the same" as "curling up before the fire."  They sexualize their charges in order to defend them.  "Light the candles, pour some scented oils and sink into the warm bath with your favorite relaxing, well-worn paperback," they coo, "Feel the weight of it, the sharp-edged softness of the pages, the leprous flaking of the cover.

Books are threatened today by the same groups that have been doing it this whole time:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="arial,sans-serif"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="arial,sans-serif"&gt;doesn't the No one wants to attack books.  The problem is that thetheir narrow The narrow.  People far more intelligent than me have pointed out that the procession from the plasticine present of written content to its gaseous future is logical not from looking at developments of the last 5 years, but of the last 500.  Long ago, men wrote books by hand.  Then, other men might, if they knew how to read and if they thought it worth their time (and time was worth more before the degree of industrialization of food production that we first-worlders enjoy today), write someone else's book again.  Then, changeable type meant that you could make scads and scads of copies just about anything.  The golden ages of Greece and Baghdad were as deserts compared to the post-Gutenberg era.  More copies of works meant that more works survived fires both accidental and purposeful, as well as more people who had read those works, having thoughts of their own concerning them, having access to a method of disseminating those thoughts widely and rapidly.  More books meant more value in the skills of reading and writing, meaning more literacy, meaning still more books.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="arial,sans-serif"&gt;    Literacy rates self-regulate at their current levels, with America at a less-than-Japan, more-than-Somalia grade.  Barring genuine public schooling reform, reading has reached a maximum point of saturation.  But writing has not.  The Internet, the quality of computers to be more useful the more other computers they can communicate with, continues Gutenberg's task, making more works available to more people.  The good people at &lt;a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/"&gt;Project Gutenberg&lt;/a&gt; take this task deadly serious.  Most of them, however, know that turning text into txt is only the first step.  It is the following step that seems the doozy to the tradition-valuing publisher, reader and writer, that seems a horror story with some shiny-eyed Fritz Lang social planners as the antagonists.  Google, to take an example dear to my heart, does not wish to scan the world's information, but to index it.  When I start to ponder that, images of hyperdimensional virtual &lt;i&gt;spines&lt;/i&gt; rise that would have made Leibniz proud to know how right he was, but they just make me breath fast and give strange sighing, mewling noises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="arial,sans-serif"&gt;    The Internet is not entirely unlike Plato's old bugaboo: The world of Forms.  Someone might claim that this page does exist somewhere, in a pattern of particles not unlike anything else.  They would say that I wrote it, it then traveled to that home, a server stack in Palo Alto or Atlanta or Baltimore, and that it can subsequently travel to the terminal of anyone who accesses it through the identifier commonly called a page.  But this traveling is, in some sense, a false idea.  Signals travel between these things, but an object, like a computer, cannot contain a thought.  Signals induce thoughts, but can't equate to them.  Only people (using the term loosely) have thoughts.  The Internet is not unlike me looking through binoculars at something I wouldn't ordinarily see, like, say, a buzzard soaring over a distant highway or parking lot.  When I see him, that buzzard is exactly as present as if he were sitting next to me or, more poetically, as if I was flying next to him.  And if I took a picture through a telephoto lens of that view of the buzzard that gave me that moment of closeness, I could return to that thermal in that cobalt sky at any time in future.  And if I gave a copy of that picture to someone else, they would join me in that perfect and unchanging sky, with that perfect and unchanging bald scavenger, until an infinite number of people come to coincide in that single spaceless space for all of timeless time.  The sky is not in the picture, or the binoculars, or the photons whose sussurating impacts convince me of it's existence.  The sky &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt;, both up there and, in some way, in me and anyone else thinking about it.  Regarding it, let's say.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="arial,sans-serif"&gt;    Plato thought that ideas didn't come from people, that there were a limited number of them, and that they were things or places that we saw or went when we regarded them.  His obvious mistake, to most modern thinkers, is to assume their absolute permanence.  He wanted them to be perfect, you see.  Nowadays, perfection is usually seen as a limit condition.  The greater the rate at which something improves, the better it is.  Software A and B are identical in feature set, usability and price.  Software A will be updated three times at intervals of two months before its developers are pulled for more profitable ventures.  Software B will be updated incrementally, once a week, forever.  Software B is more perfect than software A.  Our modern perfection adjusts.  Plato's forms are ridiculous, in that light.  We all know that sometimes, people have had ideas that no one else ever did, and that other people have made those ideas better.  Bell made a phone and Edison made it usable.  Things have continuously and gradually improved.  What could be wrong with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="arial,sans-serif"&gt;    Life arose from a soup.  Molecules fizzed around.  Some of them found they fit with others, and more complex molecules grew.  Eventually, systems came to be, ideas before anyone could have ideas as we understand it, the thoughts and dreams of proteins and virii and, a ridiculously long time later, bacteria.  Fish, reptiles, mammals, humans, iron, the cotton gin, the Internet.  The next step I referred to is something like rendering the blocky, gamey substance of the sum of human knowledge, dicing and misting it, putting it in suspension of something suitably fluid.  Making a soup.  This being done, different groups will keep trying different plans and programs in different pools and ponds and oceans and pots of this soup until something happens.  System.  Life, we call it when it's made of proteins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="arial,sans-serif"&gt;    Is continuous and gradual improvement sounding scary yet?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="arial,sans-serif"&gt;    The point is, publishing is so easy now that it is worth next to nothing, and it will gradually be worth less and less as it becomes universal.  People whose self-importance is defined by being published will complain and fight for fear of being made irrelevant.  People like me, on the other hand, will eventually realize that they aren't being self important just because they happened to scrawl something on the Internet, that infinitely wide restroom wall.  I do not particularly fear judgement from people I can see, and the distant invisible cannot be any more frightening.  Swallowing my fear of hubris, then, is all I need to do before everything I think becomes fair game for mass consumption.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font face="arial,sans-serif"&gt;*: The Only Real Argument, or the real reason that people disagree with one another, all other claimed reasons (statistics, logic, quotation of religious of areligious texts) being merely summoned to reinforce a feeling of rightness in the arguer or the target of argument.  In brief, it amounts to something like "I would have it seem this way to me."&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Nick</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/6560322342386588636'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/6560322342386588636'/><author><name>Nick Novitski</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08863651199447917923</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31707300.post-4240506175410006627</id><published>2008-03-01T15:12:00.002-05:00</published><updated>2009-10-06T16:35:51.792-04:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='dreams'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='fiction'/><title type='text'>Dream: The End of Technology</title><content type='html'>Someone is writing a letter. &amp;nbsp;No, it's vaguer than that. &amp;nbsp;Some kind of text, in some kind of medium, conveyed to me by the narrator. &amp;nbsp;He's invented something, and he's writing a...message, that he hopes will explain it, and his actions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As he addresses his unknown audience to come, the camera occasionally shows him (Am I him? &amp;nbsp;No, I am the camera) in his home, or laboratory (always alone, whether working, eating, or just gazing at a barren, nearly lunar landscape through thick bay windows), but most of the shots don't show anyone. &amp;nbsp;They're heavily filtered, grainy and yellowed, and depict seemingly random scenes (an empty school playground, an oak tree in a field seen from a passing car, a city from): he's thinking about his past, his life up to this point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He's not talking about the past, though. &amp;nbsp;He doesn't bother explaining the function of the machine, but he knows that it will be found - he's addressing the finders - and he's confident it can be easily duplicated. &amp;nbsp;It's energy-intensive, but considering the effects...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this point, he pauses to look meaningfully at a closet-sized booth that stands open in the center of his lab space. &amp;nbsp;This is the focus of the power of the machinery - mostly computational - which twists and burrows through the surrounding cold and rocky ground (ah, it's an asteroid, the ultimate in privacy, his people have already started flitting around their solar system). &amp;nbsp;When the machine is activated, the space&amp;nbsp;inside that container is exchanged with an equivalent space in a sufficiently described universe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting that description was the trick. &amp;nbsp;Properly encoding the test destination string took years, and accurately storing it was an exercise in multiple redundancy, immense files duplicated and re-versioned across a dozen&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He could destroy it, of course. &amp;nbsp;Destroy it, and deny the true happiness of everyone in his&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Nick</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/4240506175410006627'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/4240506175410006627'/><author><name>Nick Novitski</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08863651199447917923</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31707300.post-1314858373036493991</id><published>2008-02-29T16:15:00.003-05:00</published><updated>2008-08-23T07:31:25.115-04:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='issue zero'/><title type='text'>Drunken Hobo Theory</title><content type='html'>I just realized that I didn't explain in &lt;a href="http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2008/02/issue-zero-mechanics.html"&gt;the previous post&lt;/a&gt; why I called one of the difficulties in translating &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Breaking the Ice&lt;/span&gt; into &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Issue Zero&lt;/span&gt; the "drunken hobo issue."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I heard it, Stephen Jay Gould invented the drunken hobo as an example of a certain kind of system.  In his case, he was trying to explain why the evolution of intelligence wasn't as unlikely as it seemed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imagine a drunken hobo walking down the sidewalk.  For every step he takes forward, his inebriation and loss of balance simultaneously takes him one step either to the left or right.  Let's say he's walking on the right side of the street; to his right is the wall of buildings, and to his left is the gutter.  If he's walked far enough to the right such that he's hitting the wall, he can't go any further right, just either forward or forward-and-left.  On the other hand, if he walks far enough to the left, he falls in the gutter, hits his head, and sleeps until he is found by street cleaners the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The point of this is, no matter how unlikely it is that the hobo step to the left, even if it's only a 1% chance opposed to a 99% chance that he'll step right, such a system always ends exactly the same way, with the hobo in the gutter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Gould's case, he was arguing that intelligence was such a system: brain mass (or whatever other biological factors self-awareness and abstract thought depends on) can only &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;decrease&lt;/span&gt; so much, so no matter how unlikely its &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;increase&lt;/span&gt; is, passing the level needed for true intelligence is just a matter of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my case, I just meant to suggest that Issue Zero should&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; be a drunken hobo system, but that Breaking the Ice isn't.  I have to change a game with an uncertain outcome into a system with a given outcome.  So rather than playing three dates and tallying up attraction levels and compatibilities to see how well they did, I might just require a certain number of each, and end the game whenever those numbers are reached.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm glad we had this talk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Nick</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2008/02/drunken-hobo-theory.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/1314858373036493991'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/1314858373036493991'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2008/02/drunken-hobo-theory.html' title='Drunken Hobo Theory'/><author><name>Nick Novitski</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08863651199447917923</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31707300.post-6730276785383109041</id><published>2008-02-29T10:00:00.001-05:00</published><updated>2009-03-02T22:22:41.536-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='issue zero'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='gaming'/><title type='text'>Issue Zero Mechanics</title><content type='html'>This is what &lt;a href="http://www.story-games.com/"&gt;story-games&lt;/a&gt; might call a "little idea"; a system that is more of a sub-system, which can partially inform a game, or be bolted on to one.  Since I'm doing the latter, I want to make it system-agnostic, which is to say, such that it doesn't refer to features of the parent game it is bolted to which not all games have; it should work with every game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet, that's not precisely possible.  Let's look at some exceptions, before identifying our target group, and the proposed goals of this project.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, some games either provide an explicit context for the character's adventuring together, or obviate it altogether by requiring them to &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; adventure together.  For example, in &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;AGON&lt;/span&gt;, the player characters are literally in the same boat, sent from island to island by the whim of the gods.  Since they have a history already (the Trojan War), are now stuck with one another and are given goals as a group, there's no question of how they came to be together, or why they continue to be together.  From the opposite end of this spectrum, in &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;The Shab al-Hiri Roach&lt;/span&gt;, the player characters are all faculty at Pemberton College, scheming to win tenure for themselves.  There's no question why they're stuck with each other, but since they are working at cross-purposes, constantly undercutting one another, there's no need to give a reason for them to work together, since they conspicuously don't: That's the point of the game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, some games use systems which permit or force asynchronous or partially-synchronous play.  This sounds fancier than it really is.  I just mean that, for some games, "splitting up the party" isn't the trouble and strife which it is in &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Dungeons and Dragons&lt;/span&gt; and all other games suspiciously similar to it.  For example, since a given turn of &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;WUSHU&lt;/span&gt; can represent any length of in-fiction time, and the goals and challenges are defined in terms of fiction rather than reality, the characters can be working together no matter how far away they are.  In a given turn, one player might narrate how he disables the Death Star's tractor beam, while two others describe breaking into the detention level to rescue the fourth, who herself is describing the things she did in an earlier, failed escape attempt, and how those things are assisting the others.  Wushu is an extreme example, but many people seem to play the slightly-more-fixed-in-space-and-time &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Sorceror&lt;/span&gt; in this way as well: The system runs smoothly and swiftly enough that letting one person do a few things by themselves is no great burden, as long as it comes back to you eventually.  Other games explicitly apportion this time in the spotlight: in &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Don't Rest Your Head&lt;/span&gt;, only one character &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;acts&lt;/span&gt; in each scene, though more than one might be present.  There is no pressing need, in any of these games, for the characters to remain in a single group, and in all but &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;WUSHU&lt;/span&gt;, there's no need for them even to have non-conflicting goals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, what we're looking for is a game whose system in practice requires that the heroes stay close to one another, but whose fiction does not provide a reason for that togetherness.  In the absence of this latter, the Issue Zero system will provide a method for determining a premise for group adventure, a reason for the characters cohering into that classic standard unit, the "party."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As inspiration, let's look at every buddy movie ever made.  Here we have two people who may not have much in common (in fact, the less they like one another, the more entertaining it is!), and who may have never met, but for some event which compels them together.  After they have been introduced to the audience, the story begins with something happening such that...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;They &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;must&lt;/span&gt; stick together.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;This may be because one of them is under orders to stick with the other (&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Rush Hour&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Lethal Weapon&lt;/span&gt;), or because one sees a utility in the other (&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Midnight Run&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;48 Hours&lt;/span&gt;), or just because of circumstances (&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Every Movie Where Two Guys are Chained Together or are Mistaken for Friends, to Their Detriment&lt;/span&gt;).  It's possible that they each have their reasons for sticking with the other, or even both of them want out of the arrangement, but for some amount of time, whether as brief as a stopover in JFK or as long as a quest for the lost treasure of the Aztecs, stuck they remain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for adventuring, this is insufficient.  However compelling the reason that you have to hang together, the more time passes, the more likely that the characters will find ways to hang separately.  Maybe one will decide the dingus we're all questing for isn't worth the risk, or maybe he'll find something else he wants more, or maybe he'll just escape the captivity or responsibility that bound him.  Whatever the case, it will either happen, or the GM or group will noticeably hand-wave it away.  LAME.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus, as you see in every buddy movie, something else will develop.  Though the original reason for the two's juxtaposition has fallen away, there stands revealed a deeper bond.  Friendship, respect, love, admiration...whatever you want to call it, despite their differences...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;They &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;want&lt;/span&gt; to stick together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;There's something that each has come to see and appreciate in the other.  It's even possible that the original reason hasn't been resolved yet, but the important thing is, even if it was, the two heroes would remain friends.  Of course, though the buddy movie example is a case of two people, a game might (and probably will) feature more than two protagonists, and obviously, the more people in the party, the more necessary an explicit reason that each stays with all the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So that's what Issue Zero should do:  For each pair of characters, tell a story that starts with "how we met and why it didn't end there," and ends with "how we came to realize that we were meant to continue on together."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to how, it's occurred to me that the buddy-cop premise mirrors very closely the romantic-comedy premise, and there already is a romantic-comedy fiction game, &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Breaking the Ice&lt;/span&gt;.  If I wanted to try to use &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;BtI&lt;/span&gt; in this way, I would need to modify it such that I fixed the terminology issue and the drunken hobo issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The terminology issue is simply that certain aspects of the game's system are named assuming the specifically romantic involvement of the two principals.  They go out on a series of "Dates," are awarded "Attraction Levels" for successful rolls.  Now, I'm perfectly happy to admit that the buddies in buddy films do grow to love each other, but "love" is a loaded and ambiguous term in modern english, so I'd much rather strip it out and replace it with a concept more immediately approachable.  Demographics suggest that, at least in my own games, men will be playing Issue Zero with other men, and I am willing to take steps to assist their imaginations and assuage their discomfort.  In any case, renaming "attraction" "affection" should be alright, though "date" gives me a bigger problem.  It's clear, watching buddy films, when the characters are out on a "date" in &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;BtI&lt;/span&gt; terms, but I'm not sure what to call them.  I want the term to be suggestively neutral, if that makes any sense.  For now, I guess I'll just call them "events."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The drunken hobo issue is the difference between the full game that &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;BtI&lt;/span&gt; is, with player efforts towards a positive resolution, and the pre-game that Issue Zero would be, where the ending is already written: the group has already made their band of heroes, and we're presuming that they do admire one another and adventure together.  Taking a first stab at altering the game to fit that presumption, I'll try...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Removing the patented favorite color character generation engine.  The players will have already made their characters in the system of the "actual" game, so they'll just use those character sheets and concepts as inspiration for the traits of the BtI character.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Only running two "dates."  The third date is the adventure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;I'm going to try having two people actually play this on Sunday.  As they say in &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Polaris&lt;/span&gt;, we shall see what comes of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Nick</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2008/02/issue-zero-mechanics.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/6730276785383109041'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/6730276785383109041'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2008/02/issue-zero-mechanics.html' title='Issue Zero Mechanics'/><author><name>Nick Novitski</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08863651199447917923</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31707300.post-5686396378412352462</id><published>2008-02-26T15:14:00.005-05:00</published><updated>2009-06-01T22:24:20.261-04:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ethics'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='then I had some toast'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='school'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='writing'/><title type='text'>Oral Examination: After-Action Report and Summary</title><content type='html'>In short, my oral went well.  Extremely well.  My advisor, Mr. Tuck, attended.  I have it on good authority that, just before I entered the room with the committee and the process began, he had been complaining about the format of orals and questioning their worth as part of the curriculum.  I am further told that, once it was over and I and the committee left to take our robes off, he was speechless, in a good way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's no higher praise I could possibly receive.  I think I owe it, at least in part, to the members of my committee, two of which I had to be introduced to, but all of whom had not only read my paper, but seen in it something striking and beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://docs.google.com/Doc?id=dhm89zgn_188g8tz9wcn"&gt;You may feel free to come to your own conclusions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a bonus, I include here the summary of my paper that, as &lt;a href="http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2008/02/final-hurdle-before-graduation.html"&gt;my previous post&lt;/a&gt; mentioned, I was required to present at the beginning of the examination.  I decided to skip over the chronological recounting of events that took up most of the paper in favor of a summary of the final positions of the characters, what Tolstoi intends by them, and my response to his implicit claims,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That all sounds great, but don't expect to much: I fired it off in a hurry, half this weekend, half this morning.  It's disconnected, rambling, discursive, and equal parts cynical modern materialism and geeky starry-eyed transhumanism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was too busy reading it off the printed page to notice at the time, but people in a position to watch the committee say that they &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;loved&lt;/span&gt; it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Leo Tolstoi was a man possessed of prodigious insight and the ability to communicate it.  That makes him a philosopher, and he had something to say about philosophy, through the thoughts and lives of Andrei and Pierre.  If these two are meant to comprise all possible philosophic responses to Tolstoi's deterministic universe, then we must apparently choose between Pierre's humanistic cynicism, living and loving and happily enduring the faults and foibles of the ignorant, and Andrei's suicidal wisdom, pursuing full knowledge of everything at the cost of caring about anything.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Both paths are marked by an atheistic acceptance of events as they happen.  I say "atheistic" since though both both characters' repeatedly reference "God" over the course of their respective revelations, that "god" is entirely absent, indistinguishable from "whatever happens to occur."  In this light, there is no path for the philosopher, no life of the mind, since what we think is a function of what we have experienced, and no god or will exists which can steer us one way or the other.  The course of our lives is just a mark of who we are, not who we would have ourselves be.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;But that said, just as the earth appears to be still, our actions appear to result from our decisions.  Until a science of psychology as fixed and known as the science of physics is discovered, we can only encourage each other to examine themselves and determine whether they'd prefer to relax and accept the simple joys around us, or to reject those joys and seek transcendence to some other, inhuman existence.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;What Tolstoi's philosophy seems to have gotten most wrong is it's ascribing to life and living things a boundless, unpredictable and unknowable infinitude of purpose.  This theory has become less and less likely as the physical, biological and psychic sciences have advanced and converged.  Much more likely has become the advent of a rigorous science of thought, not merely analytic, but experimental and synthetic.  When it becomes  possible to alter, and even create, modes of mind as we wish, then philosophers, people who have been trained to know themselves and others, to possess insight and communicate it, will be more crucially necessary than at any other time in human history.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Despite this forgivable failure of imagination, Tolstoi has shown a way for the modern philosopher in the every-growing wilderness of knowledge: even in the face of comprehensive materialism, yet we may think, and live, and love, if that is what we wish.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Nick</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2008/02/oral-examination-after-action-report.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/5686396378412352462'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/5686396378412352462'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2008/02/oral-examination-after-action-report.html' title='Oral Examination: After-Action Report and Summary'/><author><name>Nick Novitski</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08863651199447917923</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31707300.post-8724332897921221971</id><published>2008-02-23T16:30:00.001-05:00</published><updated>2009-03-02T22:22:24.493-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='actual play'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='gaming'/><title type='text'>My Current Gaming: AGON and Weapons of the Gods</title><content type='html'>It doesn't rain but that it pours: I have no ongoing games for nearly a year, and all of a sudden, two groups of three coalesce around two games I've been wanting to run for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.agon-rpg.com/"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 130%;"&gt;AGON&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cooperation is competition in this game of heroic greek adventure&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;in the vein of the &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Odyssey&lt;/span&gt;.  It's basically the Dungeons and Dragons formula made explicit: Gods give the players quests, they overcome the obstacles which the Moderator provides.  There's a budgeting system: Moderators get a pool of "strife," based on how long they've decided the quest should be and how many players there are, which is spent from to create challenges and enemies.  There's also a ranking system:  The characters are all "balanced" against one another, so that the players compete to achieve the maximum amount of glory before their hero either dies or is permitted to reach their home island.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The players had played it with me once before, in a group of five, all of whom were playing for the first time, as was I.  The result then was an extremely slow and careful process.  I decided that this time, the mitts were off:  I spent over half my strife pool on a single NPC and his war-band.  The tempo and tenor of the battle changed as the group realized that, perhaps unlike in many other games, their survival depended on strategic use of their abilities.  Also, that I was trying to &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;KILL&lt;/span&gt; them.  We were interrupted by the limited hours of our dining hall, but even taking that into account, I think my pacing sucked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps it's just lack of familiarity, but I spent too much time looking things up, not finding them, hesitating, stumbling...Basically, I look forward to being able to feel that I'm getting better, but that day has not yet come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also contend that the book is at least a little bit to blame, with sometimes less-than-optimal organization, and being rigidly specific on most things, while maddeningly vague on others (How do players neutralize Advantage dice?  Do you earn Glory when enemies surrender?  When they call for a truce?  If enemies get away from a battle alive, can their wounds be healed?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The game comes standard with a &lt;a href="http://random-average.com/Agon/HomePage"&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt;, which has become a very popular support option for games lately, with good reason: It centralizes every good idea (and some meh ones) that people have had about the game.  Open-source for analog experiences!  We used the &lt;a href="http://random-average.com/Agon/HeroicTraitConstructionKit"&gt;build-your-own Heroic Trait Option&lt;/a&gt;, and that turned out fantastic.  I'll probably suggest we another similarly flexible generalization from the book's list of special maneuvers, &lt;a href="http://random-average.com/Agon/Tricks"&gt;Combat Tricks&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href="http://random-average.com/Agon/ModifiedRefreshment"&gt;Revised Refreshment&lt;/a&gt; (something that the PCs need post-haste, after my delightful NPC got through with them) for variety and strategy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We aren't playing this week, due to a brief interruption in service (a player being visited by family), but next week will see the conclusion of one, perhaps two quests!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.eos-press.com/products-wotg.html"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 130%;"&gt;Weapons of the Gods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WotG ("wawt-guh," as I call it) is a game of wuxia action, intrigue and passion.  What's wuxia?  Well, wuxia movies are to kung fu movies what kung fu movies are to...well, more mundane films.  The radness-progression is something like:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Mundane Fiction&lt;/span&gt;: People fight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Kung Fu Fiction&lt;/span&gt;: People punch through walls and leap through the air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Wuxia Fiction&lt;/span&gt;: People fly, cut through steel, sound and light with magic sword, and coruscate with raw power when incensed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We haven't played yet: It's a new game to us all, and has several innovations which take even more accustoming to.    Hopefully, our next meeting will include the completion of standard character creation, and the move on to situation creation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WotG is a "big" game, which means that a group needs to somehow focus and direct the premise down to a manageable level.  If a game has a broad and varied setting, and characters have broad and varied capabilities, then you have to sit down and agree exactly what sort of things you'd like to do or see happen.  I will probably do that with my theme music system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's also sometimes a need to give the players a context between their characters.  When I ran a game of &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Dogs in the Vineyard&lt;/span&gt;, I told the players to explain their characters to each other, then asked them what their characters most and least liked about each other.  &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Dogs &lt;/span&gt;is a game about what the players and their characters think should be done and the conflicts those judgments engender and conclude, so that worked; WotG is also about heroic brotherhood, so I might also steal a page from &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;AGON&lt;/span&gt;, which has the characters saving each other's lives before the game starts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A system for briefly narrating events that are explicitly happening "before the game starts" might be useful for any game.  Even &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;The Shab-al Hiri Roach&lt;/span&gt; starts with your character having a positive impression of the character of the player to your right, and a negative one of the player to your left, encouraging you to provide an explanation, and thus, a history.  In big and less focused games, it becomes even more helpful.  I believe I shall refer to such mechanics as "Issue Zero Systems," after the (admittedly ridiculous) practice of releasing a collector's issue before a comic is launched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll see how it works out tomorrow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Nick</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2008/02/my-current-gaming-agon-and-weapons-of.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/8724332897921221971'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/8724332897921221971'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2008/02/my-current-gaming-agon-and-weapons-of.html' title='My Current Gaming: AGON and Weapons of the Gods'/><author><name>Nick Novitski</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08863651199447917923</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31707300.post-171347398388080531</id><published>2008-02-19T12:00:00.003-05:00</published><updated>2009-03-02T22:24:50.609-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='art'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ethics'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='gaming'/><title type='text'>Open Source vs. Art</title><content type='html'>So I know that &lt;a href="http://www.opensource.org/"&gt;Open Source&lt;/a&gt; makes sense.  Blah blah blah, the &lt;a href="http://catb.org/%7Eesr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/"&gt;Cathedral and the Bazaar&lt;/a&gt;:  If our priorities are the quality of the software, then all evidence suggests that we should make viewing, changing and redistributing the source code of that software as easy as possible.  Those who argue otherwise have a differing priority, almost always personal wealth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now consider the case of &lt;a href="http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/"&gt;Dwarf Fortress&lt;/a&gt;.  Made over more than a decade by a single developer (admittedly sometimes with the ideas of one other) pursuing his unique vision, the sole member of the non-existent "Fantasy World Simulator" genre, Dwarf Fortress is an astounding tribute to the power of ignoring what's possible, making the game you want to play, and general excellence.  Tarn Adams is a man of immense talent and dedication, and he's made something that, despite having graphics and interface like nothing you've ever seen (or, probably, ever wanted to), has rocked the digital gaming literati.  Considering its history, its uniqueness and process intensity, it might be the most incredible game any of us ever see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's also unfinished.  It's in alpha, and has been since forever.  The &lt;a href="http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/features.html"&gt;features list&lt;/a&gt; beggars belief, but it's nothing compared to the &lt;a href="http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/dev.html"&gt;development plan&lt;/a&gt;.  Mr. Adams is in it for the long term.  Despite a rabid grass roots community springing up around it practically overnight, despite many cogent offers, he has not sold the game to a commercial developer or publisher, nor has he put it under an open source license.  To be clear:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mr. Adams refuses to connect his game with any studio or publisher, because he worries he will lose control of his work; specifically, that he wouldn't be able to spend his time on the problems that personally interest him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mr. Adams refuses to release his game under an open source license, because he worries he will lose control of his work; specifically, that he wouldn't ever be able to make money on his work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;You might accuse him of waffling, of being in truth only motivated, though not by greed, by instead a prickly selfishness: rather than wanting the software to improve like we do, he wants it to be &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;his&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Playing Dwarf Fortress for any length of time gives you a easy analogy for his behavior.  Occasionally, you will receive a message that one of your craftsdwarves has taken a "fey mood."  If you're me, you'll be confused, and try to learn more.  All you'll find, though, is that they're muttering about a seemingly random series of substances, and hanging about by themselves.   In fact, they seem to be chasing out anyone who stumbles into their  workshop before resuming the difficult work of sitting in the middle of it, doing nothing.  Maybe you'll try getting some of these substances!  Maybe you'll fail to do so before their mood becomes less "fey" and more "murderous," and the nearest makeshift weapon becomes the doom of the ten or twelve hapless dwarves who first stumble within reach.  Maybe some guards will eventually put the frothing craftsdwarf down, or maybe, if you're me, the slaughter will continue until the raving murderer, festooned with the entrails of those he once called friend, stalks the empty, blood-soaked halls of your fortress, howling for onyx and anthracite, and you're forced to abandon the site and try to shake memories of what you witnessed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's go back a bit.  If you aren't me (or if you are, but are more prepared this time), you might have given the craftsdwarf what they wanted, which they would have greedily grabbed them and taken them back to the workshop.  A few days of strange noises later, they will emerge with something amazing.  It could be anything: a chalice, a shield, a spear, a ring, a robe, anything!  But it will inevitably be the most beautiful example of that kind of thing you've ever seen.  It will be worth a fortune.  It will be proof that the dwarves are descended from the First Maker and yet bear his legacy.  It will be the reason that those of the taller races speak of the halls of the dwarven forgers in tones of hushed awe.  It will be ornate, but invulnerable, gorgeous, yet functional, and it will almost certainly bear an image of some moment in the history of &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;your fortress.  &lt;/span&gt;It might be one of the high points in your history of playing the game: days, if not weeks, of wrestling with a new way of interpreting letters and symbols and a new system of key-strokes to manipulate them, and here, now, you have gotten something unexpectedly amazing out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Subtract my fannishness, and you might have how Mr. Adams sees the artistic process.  Or rather, the process of an artisan, which is undoubtedly what he is.  We don't ask a master violin-maker to out-source some of his method to interested volunteers, just so he can make his violins &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;better&lt;/span&gt;.  In fact, we don't even criticize him: if we know violins at all, we know the way the master makes them is beyond our judgment.  He invests himself in each part of it, he expresses himself through it.  It's like a painting that you can play.  It's made how it's made, and it's done when it's done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first looked at the problem, I thought I might be the calm and inviting voice that helped Mr. Adams see the sense in open source, but now, I'm less sure in my advocacy.  Are there, in fact, any advantages to open source for the artisan developer?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Nick</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2008/02/open-source-vs-art.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/171347398388080531'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/171347398388080531'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2008/02/open-source-vs-art.html' title='Open Source vs. Art'/><author><name>Nick Novitski</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08863651199447917923</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31707300.post-8805231330150094480</id><published>2008-02-19T08:03:00.002-05:00</published><updated>2009-06-01T22:24:20.262-04:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='then I had some toast'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='school'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='writing'/><title type='text'>Final Hurdle Before Graduation</title><content type='html'>&lt;span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 100%;"&gt;So after some early mishaps, I wrote &lt;a href="http://docs.google.com/Doc?id=dhm89zgn_188g8tz9wcn"&gt;my last annual essay&lt;/a&gt;.  It's about War &amp;amp; Peace, which is a great book now available in a new best-ever translation, but you don't really need to have read the book to understand the essay.  I'm fairly proud of it, though I wish I had more time to write it in, since I had more to say, but it's my own fault that I didn't.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 100%;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 100%;"&gt;It's written and accepted, but the fun doesn't end there!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 100%;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="font-style: italic;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 100%;"&gt;Now that your essay writing  period is over, we write to give you information about your oral examinations.   Please review this memo and let us know if you have any questions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-style: italic;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 100%;"&gt;As stated in our catalog, an  approved senior essay requires an hour-long public examination by a  committee of three tutors who have judged the essay to be acceptable.   All senior essay oral examinations will be scheduled outside of class  hours so that you (and your classmates) will be able to attend orals  without missing class.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul style="font-style: italic;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 100%;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Place:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;    All senior oral examinations take place in the King William Room in  the Barr Buchanan Center.  Prior to the exam, you will don your  cap and gown in the Robing Room across from the King William Room.&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul style="font-style: italic;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 100%;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dates&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;: Monday,  February 18 through Thursday, February 28 (prior to Spring Break); and&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div style="font-style: italic;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 100%;"&gt;Monday, March 17 through Friday, May  2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="font-style: italic;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 100%;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;What You Need to Do and  Remember&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul style="font-style: italic;"&gt;&lt;ol type="1"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 100%;"&gt;So that visitors    may have some idea of your essay’s content, you will begin by &lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;   delivering a brief summary of your paper&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.  Two minutes    in length is a suitable time.  Please read it very audibly, and    continue to speak audibly throughout the oral.  The examination    is meant to be public, and the audience will appreciate being able to    hear the conversation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul style="font-style: italic;"&gt;&lt;ol start="2" type="1"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 100%;"&gt;The most successful    orals are those that develop most like a conversation.  As in a conversation,    you are entitled to take the initiative if you feel the discourse flagging. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="font-style: italic;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 100%;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Protocol:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;   We have attached the oral examination protocol. Please read it so that  you are familiar with the procedure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul style="font-style: italic;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 100%;"&gt;1. Members of the audience  must arrive before the time scheduled for the examination. &lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt; No one should enter the King William Room after the oral has begun or  before it ends except in an emergency. &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul style="font-style: italic;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 100%;"&gt;2. The examining committee  and the student who is to be examined gather in the robing room at least  five minutes before the examination is to begin.  A member of the  committee reviews the protocol with the student.&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul style="font-style: italic;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 100%;"&gt;3. Two of the committee  members enter the King William Room before the student, and the audience  rises.  These committee members take their places at the table  and remain standing.  The third member enters with the student  and closes the door.  &lt;/span&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul style="font-style: italic;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 100%;"&gt;4. The third committee member  tips his (or her) hat to the Chair and says**:&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul style="font-style: italic;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 100%;"&gt;Mr. (or Madam) Chair,  I present ___________, candidate for the degree of Bachelor of Arts to be examined on his (or her)  essay entitled "_________________".&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul style="font-style: italic;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 100%;"&gt;5. The Chair asks everyone  to be seated.&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul style="font-style: italic;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 100%;"&gt;6. The Chair asks the student  for a brief summary of the essay, and (if necessary) ENCOURAGES EVERYONE  TO SPEAK AUDIBLY. &lt;/span&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ol start="7" style="font-style: italic;" type="1"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 100%;"&gt;Promptly after one    hour, the Chair announces the end of the examination.  As the audience    rises, the student, followed by the committee, leaves the King William    Room and returns to the robing room.  The student vacates the robing    room as soon as possible so that the committee members may confer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine is on the 26th, during lunch.  The height of inconvenience!

Why that is, again, judging from what is said on television and radio, is not known; the non-answer given is "voter apathy."  That's a description of the effect, not of the cause.  Why do so many not bother to vote?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mystery is solved by an experience of personal hardship.  I'm a registered democrat in Florida, so, as you might have heard, my vote just doesn't count.  Of course, I did not trouble myself to send in a ballot. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People make a rational calculation of self-interest before voting.  Thanks to gerrymandering and the electoral college (and delegate systems in general), what your vote is worth varies &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;immensely&lt;/span&gt;, depending on where you live and what your political preferences are.  When the reward of voting is worth less than the time you'd expend to vote, then of course you won't do it, and of course, people aren't.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What to do?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What more needs be said about the electoral college, save that if you aren't angry about it, you must not know much about it either.  The thing that always baffled me the most was being unable to understand it's purpose.  Was travel so dangerous in those days that each state had to put together an expedition just to send word of their results to Washington?  Did the founding fathers, like the Johnnies whose education is supposed to mirror theirs, hate math, and thus needed nice and small numbers to count?  In a seminar on the Federalist, another student finally gave me a simple explanation: since more people live in urban areas, and those people might have a lot in common with one another even across the country, they would dominate national elections without some sort of counter thrown up.  If presidential elections were done by popular vote, then the weight of the coasts would completely overpower the sparsely populated land-locked states.  Of course, I immediately said "And what a wonderful world it would be!"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Removing the college would require a constitutional amendment, which is difficult to manage in the best of times, which we are decidedly not fortunate enough to be living in.  However, you wouldn't need an amendment to instruct all members of the college to give their vote to the candidate who received the majority of the national popular vote.  So that's one problem solved!  Hah hah!  I laugh, because it isn't.  Actually, electoral college reform is a shockingly complex and well-studied topic, and difficult to maintain enthusiasm on or win votes with, so it's not clear that we'll ever see this nonsense resolved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of saying anything about gerrymandering or redistricting, I'm instead going to point you to the &lt;a href="http://www.redistrictinggame.org/"&gt;Redistricting Game&lt;/a&gt;, because it will rapidly show you exactly how the current system is set up, and what should be done to fix it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know, before television, voting days were big old parties, the biggest show in town.  The candidates would arrange for food and booze, music and entertainment, shamelessly trying to get people to feel briefly good about them before they voted.  People turned out in droves!  Admittedly, since the problem isn't voter turn-out, but voter not-having-a-reason-to-turn-out, having polls at the county fair and lining them with free food and beer provided by the candidates wouldn't really solve the problem.  Still, I'm going to call it Plan B.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Nick</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2008/02/voter-apathy-and-re-enfranchisement.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/7817486277808738762'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/7817486277808738762'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2008/02/voter-apathy-and-re-enfranchisement.html' title='Voter Apathy and Re-enfranchisement'/><author><name>Nick Novitski</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08863651199447917923</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31707300.post-3959892170433513684</id><published>2008-02-18T14:00:00.002-05:00</published><updated>2009-06-01T22:24:20.263-04:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ethics'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='then I had some toast'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='religion'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='politics'/><title type='text'>Rational Marriage</title><content type='html'>I've reached that age: my friends are marrying.  This has prompted me to more fully explore and define my thoughts on marriage, much to the annoyance of some around me.  Which is a shame, because it always turns out that they are annoyed not at what I'm saying but at what some imaginary angry and foolish person is saying at the same time, sounding a lot like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope I've learned enough from these mis-steps to avoid them now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For starters: When I talk about "marriage" below, I am only referring to the legal state, and not to any kind of ritual or ceremony your culture requires or encourages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Earlier this year, two freshmen were married in the halls of St. Johns.  It was a small ceremony, unattended by either family, or anyone at all except for the two themselves and a few friends.  It was performed by a tutor who may or may not be ordained.  It was, as far as the kids were concerned, a way of saying they love each other.  It was therefore equal parts adorable, hilarious and disturbing, but one thing that it wasn't?  Legally existent.  If they break up, unless a child is involved, she won't be able to pursue a claim on him.  If they earn enough money to file taxes this year, they can't file jointly.  Their ceremony, just like any other of any kind, not just marriage, has nothing to do with the law.  Our government does not recognize "unions made by God" or "life-sharing" or even "very special things between two people."  It recognizes "special tax status," and allows some pairs of people to file under it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be clear: There's nothing wrong about your ceremony!  I'm sure it's very nice, and you can have it however and whenever you want!  Just don't let's talk about it right now, because I don't really have an opinion on it, except (just like every man sometimes thinks) that some of them are a huge waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope that clears the path mentally for my thesis, which is...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Marriage licenses and pre-nuptial agreements should be combined into a single thing, a customizable contract which governs the state of being legally married.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Currently, marriage law is a hodgepodge.  Contracts, with requirements, terms, deadlines, conditions for release and breach, as well as penalties for the latter, will rectify this unsure and mutable situation.  By being required to sign and submit such a document, the parties will be encouraged to confront their opinions on what their marriage should actually entail: What they expect and require from themselves and each other.  Which is, I hope we'll all agree, something that people should do anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But maybe you don't agree.  Maybe you think this will discourage people from marrying, that if they thought about it more, they would do it less.  That's a frightening thing to believe.  Personally, I've seen lots of people only find the person they're truly happy with &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;because&lt;/span&gt; of thinking about it for a good while, and I suspect that if thinking about something discourages you from doing it, it probably wouldn't have worked out.  After all, you would have plenty of time to think about your marriage after you're married, so why not think about it now?  But this is all no doubt due to some "pro-thought" bias on my part. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may also think it unromantic.  That's a common accusation laid against the pre-nuptial agreement.  But it's not like the marriage license is any more romantic.  Neither of these documents have romance as their subject or goal: they just specify and regulate obligations.  I'm just trying to propose revisions in the law that would support making people happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's possible that you object to this valuing of the happiness of the participants over the continuity of the marriage.  There's no argument I can make against that:  I simply disagree, but that disagreement is based on postulates, not on reasons that can be persuaded away.  As far as I'm concerned, people and their feelings exist, but "relationships" and "marriages" do not exist, or at least, do not exist as separate from two people and the way they live and feel.  Marriages exist to support happiness, not the other way around, and if a marriage negatively effected your happiness, then it's without merit. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope we can at least agree that our government should never take your position.  At best, it would be unconscionable interfering in people's private lives, and at worst, it would be completely against the constitution, which has nothing good to say about a "law respecting an establishment of religion."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If, on the other hand, you have no objections to what I've said so far, then you agree that the law should support the reality and not the ideal.  In that case, you're ready for my favorite part: These contracts would have an term.  That is, when they were first written, the couple would choose a length of time (perhaps mostly between 7 and 20 years) which it would continue to be valid.  They could renew it any time they liked, but if they didn't both sign it again after the term expired, the marriage would also expire, without penalty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you and your spouse agree that you never want to be able to leave your marriage without penalties, then obviously, you should renew early and often.  If you don't trust them to renew with you indefinitely, then you can try to convince them to make the term very long (though I would recommend reconsidering the whole thing).  In general, the length of your marriage should not be effected by this method: You still leave whenever you were going to leave, even if it's death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The point is, people shouldn't say "I'm married, therefore I should feel love," they should say "I feel love, therefore I'm married."  But that said, I know that feelings can be mercurial (boy howdy, do I know it), and it can be hard to tell whether it's a brief bad spell or an irreconcilable difference.  That's what the term is for: forcing you to think long-term.  You might have a tough period that lasts for a year or five, but you won't be able to leave without penalty unless, over the course of an &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;entire term&lt;/span&gt;, not &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;once&lt;/span&gt; did you feel good enough about your marriage to promise to stay another whole term.  And of course, in case it wasn't clear, if something happens that warrants breach (what exactly that would be depends on the couple, but infidelity, violence and sudden poorness are common causes today), then it would be immediately dissolved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The way I see it, people change, and no one should be punished forever for something the person they &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;used to be&lt;/span&gt; felt.  Marriages today are of finite duration, not because of some great degradation of morals this century, but because there isn't as much advantage to being married to one person for your whole life.  Even if you were able to turn back the clock to the better time, with shorter lifespans, drastically reduced social mobility, and brutal oppression of women, you'll never end divorce in practice.  However, with my proposal, you can make sure that the natural end of every marriage is as painless, manageable, and equitable as possible. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, my goal is that only people who want to be married are married.  Again, I'm pretty sure we can all agree on that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel uncomfortable appearing to tell people what to do, so lets assuage my ego-guilt by ending this with a question.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On one hand, we have the fact that selection pressures favor polygyny, the common flavor of polygamy where men have multiple wives.  That is, polygynous societies have offspring of verifiably higher "fitness" in the evolutionary sense.  It's of clear benefit to men in general, since they have a chance to sow as many genetic oats as they can manage.  However, it's also of benefit to women, since it is more advantageous for them to have a fraction of the fittest mate, in the form of his genetic material and a little of his time and resources in raising the child, than to have the entirety of a less fit one.  In short, rich guys can keep lots of women and kids in a better lifestyle than poor guys can keep even one woman and their kids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sensible.  I'm totally in favor of it.  Actually, because I'm a dirty liberal, I'm totally in favor of anyone being able to marry anyone they like, in whatever combination of gender and number.  The contract could easily have any number of people's names on it, or you could have separate contracts with.  As I remember, in the first episode of &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Star Trek: Enterprise&lt;/span&gt; (the only one I have ever been able to sit all the way through), it's revealed that the ship's alien doctor has seven wives, who themselves each have seven husbands, of which he is only one (no doubt they were all &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_I_Was_Going_to_St_Ives"&gt;on their way to St. Ives&lt;/a&gt;).  Someone expresses astonishment at this.  Thinking a moment, the doctor responds smiling that, while it might get a little confusing, he wouldn't have it any other way.  And certainly, if I ever heard of such a structure in the real world, I would laugh, but if it was consensual and happy, then I wouldn't have it any other way.  Let all those who can sign contracts (I.E., unimpaired humans who have reached their majority), do so in whatever combination they like!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, the tax law wouldn't support it.  And, what's more important, people would frequently insist that their contract preclude any others.  So the more complex structures would be difficult, though polygamy, and especially polygyny, would be within easy reach.  Hooray!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there's a problem with my rosy picture, and it's that polygny in modern industrial societies causes the formation of cultural institutions that encourage violence in general, and violence to women in particular.  If, say, the richer 50% of men have an average of two wives each, and those wives are happy and content with their position (as the above establishes they probably would be), then that leaves the other half (which include disproportionate numbers of young people) zero possible mates.  Young dudes with neither mates nor the reasonable prospect of mates are much more likely to take life-threatening risks, and to be murderously violent.  See, for one of the best examples, the young and unmarried jihadis and suicide bombers of Saudi Arabia, et al.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, what's the resolution?  Do we let the successful enjoy the fruits of their labor (and priviledged birth), or do we try to minimize as much as possible the radicalization of our youth and underclass? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Nick</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2008/02/rational-marriage.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/3959892170433513684'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/3959892170433513684'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2008/02/rational-marriage.html' title='Rational Marriage'/><author><name>Nick Novitski</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08863651199447917923</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31707300.post-2843946464430094586</id><published>2008-02-18T12:00:00.001-05:00</published><updated>2008-02-18T11:53:56.671-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='crucible'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='gaming'/><title type='text'>Kung Fu Crucible: A premise that should be a game</title><content type='html'>The &lt;a href="http://www.sjgames.com/pyramid/sample.html?id=2848"&gt;Kung Fu Crucible&lt;/a&gt; is my role-playing white whale.  Written by &lt;a href="http://chadu.livejournal.com/"&gt;Chad Underkoffler&lt;/a&gt; and published in &lt;a href="http://www.sjgames.com/pyramid/"&gt;Pyramid Magazine&lt;/a&gt; in 2002, where I read it first with interest, then with growing astonishment.  I once purchased an entire year's subscription just to be able to find it again in the archives and save it to my hard drive.  I eventually burned it to a dvd with a bunch of other fiction game material, but that dvd was damaged and discarded.  So now I may need another 20$ for another year's subscription to Pyramid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kung Fu Crucible is part of Mr. Underkoffler's Campaign in a Box series.  Each article presents a premise for a role-playing game, usually restricted in spatial scope; rather than gallivanting about the world, something is keeping the heroes in a particular location.  In this particular article, the premise us essentially identical to that of the classic TV show, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prisoner"&gt;The Prisoner&lt;/a&gt;: For unknown reasons, people are being kept in a small village, isolated from the world, forced to forget their names and organize socially along rigidly defined forms. The heroes of the game would broadly follow the form of Number Six, the hero of the show, testing the limits of their captivity, defying their mysterious captor's efforts, or cooperating with them, or not being sure which is which.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Number Six: Where am I?&lt;br /&gt;Number Two: In the Village.&lt;br /&gt;#6: What do you want?&lt;br /&gt;#2: Information.&lt;br /&gt;#6: Whose side are you on?&lt;br /&gt;#2: That would be telling. We want information. Information! INFORMATION!&lt;br /&gt;#6: You won't get it.&lt;br /&gt;#2: By hook or by crook, we will.&lt;br /&gt;#6: Who are you?&lt;br /&gt;#2: The new Number Two.&lt;br /&gt;#6: Who is Number One?&lt;br /&gt;#2: &lt;i&gt;(ignoring him)&lt;/i&gt; You are Number Six.&lt;br /&gt;#6: I am not a number — I am a free man!&lt;br /&gt;#2:&lt;i&gt; (Laughter)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: right;"&gt;Dialog heard in opening sequence of &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;The Prisoner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The difference is that, rather than the characters being secret agents, and the village being a place entirely of surface and secrets, they are powerful kung-fu warriors, and it is also a place of near-constant training and battle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love Kung Fu fiction, and I love bizarre secretive fiction.  Further, it seemed to me that these were two great tastes that go great together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kung fu warriors, driven to push their bodies beyond all sane limits, despite whatever else might be said of them, are extremely self-possessed, self-defined, and self-centered.  It's a philosophical necessity: I need this power, because it would be good for me to have it, because my moral judgments are correct and when enforced, would improve the world.  The Village exists to challenge that sense of self.  In the show, the hero is constantly being tested and experimented on, and while the ultimate purpose is a mystery, the immediate questions are those of identity: what are you and why?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spies have been, through the course of their training and work, stripped of many comfortable illusions - about politics, about society, about human nature - and thus given a great power over and outside normal people.  They're different from normal people, but they see it the the other way around: Number six thinks of normal people as unquestioning sheep, already "prisoners" in their own villages of the mind, while his own mistrust and cynical insight makes him truly human, and truly free.  Kung Fu is an externalization of that inhumanity/humanity: Those who practice it are either beyond any human judge and standard, or human to the highest degree, mastering themselves and their environment, inflicting their irresistible will on all things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spies exist to control the flow of information, so they would be gathered and hidden away in order to control that ability, in order to limit the number of people who are able to freely filter and interpret their own information.  It's obvious why, but it's equally obvious why Xia (by which, read "Kung Fu Warriors") would be gathered and hidden away too: To control the spread of abilities which let people make their own way in the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The world changes when Kung Fu is added to it.  Hobbes based his system of politics on human nature, both mental and physical; There's no man so strong that he couldn't be killed in his sleep, so we're all in more or less equal danger from one another, so we'd all equally benefit from establishing societies where violence is stemmed in some way.  But when Kung Fu is possible, then we can say that, to quote &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Tenjho Tenge&lt;/span&gt; (and lets do, because it's one of the great manga of our age), "in this world, there are unreasonably strong people."   Those people are uncontrolled, unrestrained by the laws and fears which guide the rest of us.  Clearly, something has arisen to provide those laws and fears.  The Village is necessarily terrifying, if not to the heroes, then at least to some of the other Xia stuck with them, and certainly to us mere folk vicariously parsing their fiction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I hope you can understand why this premise seemed so awesome to me, and why I have always wanted to run a game that used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;font-size:130%;" &gt;Statement of the Problem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What would that game be?  How should it best be composed in order to support what is cool about the premise?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The original article was written "rules agnostic," describing the premise in natural language ("tall and bare mountains," "powerful techniques") rather than in terms of a particular rules-system ("mountains that are difficulty 4 to climb," "techniques that give a +6 to attack and damage rolls").  The idea was that you could "port" the premise to any system you liked or, to say it more honestly, so you could tell the group that you always played with that it was a game in the same system that you always played together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Of course, Mr. Underkoffler has also written the &lt;a href="http://www.atomicsockmonkey.com/freebies.asp#pdq"&gt;Prose Descriptive Quality system&lt;/a&gt;, whose systems act on such words as "fair," "good," "poor," etc.  He has many times commented that all of his Campaigns in the Box are in practice PDQ-ready.  More on this in later posts.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem with rules-agnosticism is that it is rooted in the faulty presumptions of what I call the "old school" of roleplaying games.  To wit: Game systems are basically equally capable of portraying any fiction, and people just play the one they're most familiar with, since it's that familiarity and skill, especially on the part of the Moderator, that determines whether a game is fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Ron Edwards says in &lt;a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/_articles/system_does_matter.html"&gt;System Does Matter&lt;/a&gt;, effectively the new school's Magna Carta, "I flatly, entirely disagree."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should make it clear that "old school" and "new school" are terms of my own inventing, coined in order to avoid all the controversy that rages across the internet around around language like "indie," and also in order to make the only distinction that I think is important: how directly the game models its fiction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Old school games attempt to simulate realistic interaction of the lowest common denominators of fiction: real objects.  For example, the characters always have a collection of statistics representing physical and mental potential, most often close variations on Strength, Dexterity, Toughness, and Intelligence.  They also have another set that represents their practice and knowledge, usually called "skills."  In general, the goal of old school games is to attach a convincing mechanical act, for example rolling a die and checking a chart, to every fictional act, for example tying your shoes.  Of the two largest problems with this, the first is theoretical: Godel's incompleteness theorem applies, and there's no complex system that can simulate every possible act.  The other is practical: players get tired of rolling dice all the time, and the skill of being a Moderator becomes knowing what to ignore from the system, or when to ignore it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The system of new school games are frequently designed to model fictional acts directly, rather than physical acts directly and fictional ones incidentally.  For example, in &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Capes&lt;/span&gt;, superpowers are rated at how much effect they can have on the story, rather than their output in joules, and in &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Bliss Stage&lt;/span&gt;, supporting characters are defined mechanically by their emotional importance to the heroes, not by their bench-press and IQ.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Certain new school games, like &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Burning Empires&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Weapons of the Gods&lt;/span&gt;, retain an appearance of the old school, with traditional attribute/skill divisions, but other explicit systems are inevitably in place to focus the play along certain fictional lines.  &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Burning Empires &lt;/span&gt;characters also have intense passions and plans, and are forced to act in a context of tense planetary warfare.  &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Weapons of the Gods &lt;/span&gt;characters have driving passions, and social connections to their families and clans, and destinies, and their power is limited by the height (or depth, in the case of villains) of their virtue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Games like this are what I call "big:" players are presented with an entire world (or, in the case of &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Burning Empires&lt;/span&gt;, a system for making worlds) and a broad array of ways to interact with that world, such that the kinds of characters they can make and the kinds of stories those characters pursue are less limited than in the typical, "small," new school game.  As a perfect example of the focus of a small game, in &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;The Shab Al-hiri Roach&lt;/span&gt;, characters are either professors or assisstant professors at Pemberton University who are simultaneously struggling with tenure politics and trying to manage an insect problem (an ancient, mind-controlling insect problem).  Play progresses through a set list of chronological events, surrounding the school year of 1920-something. The play is restrictive, though also hilarious and worth playing again and again. A small games is a lot like a board game.  In &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Monopoly&lt;/span&gt;, say, players are always real-estate developers in New York, unless you play Miami Monopoly or Star Wars Monopoly, and in the same way, you can move &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;The Roach&lt;/span&gt; to other locations, and as long as the basic mechanics (whether buying and developing property or gathering renown for the sake of a life of ease) remain the same, the game will as well.  By contrast, the scope of "big" games is explicitly much larger; you could play an untenured scholar in both &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Burning Empires&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Weapons of the Gods&lt;/span&gt;, as well as any number of other character concepts, but they are always going to be either trying to save their far-future world from alien invasion, or attaining their great personal goals at the end of much hard kung-fu-ing, respectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether big or small, new school games are all designed with a self-awareness that the old school lacks.  Designers of the new school presume that, while there is no system that can model all fiction equally, &lt;span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"&gt;systems can be designed to model a given kind of fiction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;The Mountain Witch&lt;/span&gt; is about a rag-tag group of heroes caught between being unable to trust one another, and needing to.  Thus, every character has a dark secret that comes out in play, a trust rating hangs between each pair of characters and there is a betrayal mechanic which exploits that trust.  &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Capes &lt;/span&gt;is about the joy of having superpowers, and the increased expectations on characters who have them.  Thus, characters can always use their super powers, but doing so accumulates a kind of story-debt that weighs them down, until they get rid of it by winning conflicts that prove their justice or nobility.  &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Weapons of the Gods&lt;/span&gt; is about Wuxia heroes, traveling the countryside and cultivating their mastery to the greatest degree.  Thus, the character's power is limited their power is linked to the height (or depths) of their virtue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The analogy for me is the history of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_acting"&gt;method acting&lt;/a&gt;.  It was invented in the 30s, long after much acting had already been done, and was seen as something new and shocking.  But now, it's just what we would call "acting."  It was a more successful model, and it completely supplanted the old one.  As far as I'm concerned, the new school of role-playing is just as superior to the old one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, again, what would a game that sets out to bring the Crucible into the new school look like?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Nick</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2008/02/kung-fu-crucible-premise-that-should-be.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/2843946464430094586'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/2843946464430094586'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2008/02/kung-fu-crucible-premise-that-should-be.html' title='Kung Fu Crucible: A premise that should be a game'/><author><name>Nick Novitski</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08863651199447917923</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31707300.post-8426681548631391636</id><published>2008-02-18T11:47:00.005-05:00</published><updated>2010-04-20T13:32:45.103-04:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='crucible'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='gaming'/><title type='text'>Kung Fu Crucible: Inspirations</title><content type='html'>When I &lt;a href="http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2007/05/camp-nerdly-report.html"&gt;attended Camp Nerdly&lt;/a&gt; three years, I was able watch Clinton R.

Part of the game is making a large fictional world as a group, that your later stories will explore, and there's a specific order of operations that the procedure follows.  The first step is always to list the new world's inspirations: the media, whether movies, books, shows, music or games, which you want the new world to be able to claim as an influence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It struck me as a good idea for reasons I can't fully explain.

The award recognizes            scientific achievement that stands out            from the body of innovative work, that            is deeply impressive to creative masters            in the field, and that solves a            difficult problem that may have evaded            the genetics scientific community. It            recognizes the beautiful and            intellectually ingenious experimental            design and execution involved in            genetics scientific discovery.&lt;/blockquote&gt;He published &lt;a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;amp;lr=&amp;amp;q=author%3Ae-novitski&amp;amp;btnG=Search"&gt;over a hundred papers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?lr=&amp;amp;q=author%3A%22edward+novitski%22&amp;amp;btnG=Search+Books"&gt;three books&lt;/a&gt;.  The two more interesting ones are, at closest, to be found in the University of Maryland and the Library of Congress, but the famous one, The Genetics and Biology of Drosophila (fruit flies, to those not in the genetic know), is &lt;a href="http://worldcat.org/wcpa/oclc/2397390"&gt;in the college library&lt;/a&gt;.  Getting it now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Genetics            researchers using Drosophila and other            model organisms have, over the years,            conceived of and executed experiments            that are monuments to an exceptional            caliber of intellectual creativity that            were impressive to colleagues at the            time, rewarding to the researchers            themselves through the joy of cracking a            difficult problem, and are still            impressive today. It is important to            recognize the level of beautiful,            intellectually ingenious, and creative            experimental design and experimental            execution. You know when you see it,            when a master in the field says            something like, “Wow, how did they ever            figure out how to do that; it’s            beautiful.” (For examples of this, see            Novitski 2005, pp. 132-137.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;Well, I would certainly &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;like&lt;/span&gt; to see examples of this in "&lt;a href="http://www.google.com/products?q=141347084X"&gt;Novitski 2005&lt;/a&gt;."  It looks like an interesting work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's a game I read (and will soon be playing) that seeks to model the fiction of Wuxia, Heroic/Mythic China.  As in so many Role-playing games, there are points which can be spent to increase the heroes skills and capabilities.  Semi-uniquely, they can also be spent to tie the hero to the world in some way, which is why they are called "Destiny."  One of the things that can be purchased is a strong descent, "by blood &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;or martial tradition&lt;/span&gt;," (emphasis mine) from some famous or infamous folk from history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's likely I'm not related to this person.  "Novitski" means "new people" in Polish, and it was the name given to any families who migrated over the eastern border unable to speak enough Polish to communicate effectively what their real name was.  Descent by blood is impossible, but descent by martial tradition is a matter of character and choice, and I think I might want to choose it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They say you can't choose your relatives.  They're full of it.  If you don't like the people around you, nothing is keeping you there besides you.  Leave, whether in spirit or in the physical as well, and find someplace more to your liking, full of people you'd prefer to dimly reflect, or better, to brilliantly improve upon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Descent" is a misnomer, an artifact of medieval thought, that what was separated from us by the past was as glorious as our present was drab, that things could only descend, degenerate, as time went on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From now on, only Ascend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Nick</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2008/02/choose-your-relatives.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/4288032391553870234'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/4288032391553870234'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2008/02/choose-your-relatives.html' title='Choose Your Relatives'/><author><name>Nick Novitski</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08863651199447917923</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31707300.post-3516370711044492069</id><published>2008-02-11T17:15:00.004-05:00</published><updated>2009-03-02T22:25:46.743-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='music'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='soundtrack'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='gaming'/><title type='text'>Adding Effective Theme Music to Role-Playing Games</title><content type='html'>Role-playing games, at least as I have experienced them, are missing music.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that music is one of my great emotional fracture-points.  Books can't make me cry, but movies can.  To be specific, while compelling and sad stories can make me sad, regardless of their medium, they essentially never make me cry.  Only tragic things &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;which are also real&lt;/span&gt; have a chance at affecting me in that way.  But when movies instead seek to stir me, to present me not with something tragic, but something immense, with people of super-human passions and characters committing themselves to greatness regardless of the potential or unavoidable cost to their bodies and lives, as well as music that fits the action, then I &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;happily and regularly cry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of which is, to vastly over-generalize, exactly what should be happening in a serious roleplaying session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best example I can think of at the moment (mostly since I watched it twice today) is the scene in Kung Fu Hustle that ends with Coolie catching the lighter.  Kung Fu Hustle has some of the best music I've seen in a movie, and the scene in question lets almost all sound effects fall into silence as the trilling of zithers builds upon a simple cascading theme into a swelling heroic anthem.  Your eyes are telling you something terrible is going to happen, and your ears are telling you that the hero enters only when things seem to have reached their worst.  It's a tension that gets me tearing up with joy every time.  Every.  Time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When role-playing games were (or are) variations on the tactical war-game, music would distract players from the explicit purpose of planning moves for maximizing your side's advantage.  But now that we have games whose explicit purpose is emotionally focused, or at least mood-centric, music's absence is no longer required.  In fact, its presence is demanded, at least by me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've thought this before, and tried to do something about it.  I assembled playlists from what music I had and could get, and brought them to gaming sessions, either as CDs or on a digital media player.  It was unsatisfying.  The music wasn't played often enough, and wasn't matched to the mood enough.  It didn't ever have remotely the same effect that it's had in the movies whose magic I was hoping to bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I don't feel able to successfully deliver on the promise of a game-playing technology, I either drop it, or I try to figure out a way to convince players to do it for me.  So that's what I'm up to here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The idea is, the group collaborates to put together a soundtrack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As part of character creation, every player selects a theme: Any song that they think should play when their character is either doing the thing she's best at or expressing her innermost feelings.  Important not-player-controlled characters who should be recurring regularly (player rivals, loved-ones, the Boss Monster, etc.) get one too, selected by the Moderator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Though, of course, it goes without saying that everyone at the table should be cool with every song being chosen)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, you need the slightly more abstract and "thematic" Themes.  If you'll forgive me for borrowing terminology from video game development, you'll want to make a list of your game's planned "high-level verbs."  That is, as a group (chalkboards help), write all the kinds of action that the game should feature.  "High-level" just means that you focus on the verbs that are composed of lots of little verb-atoms: rather than initiative rolls or token allocation or combat phases, these are the kinds of scenes the heroes will become a part of.  For example, if you're playing an archetypal dungeon crawl, you might come up with something like this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Venturing into dark and dangerous caves,&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fighting in pitched battles,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Facing the Boss at the bottom of the dungeon,&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Collecting immense treasure, and&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shopping/Carousing to prepare for the next adventure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;You should have at least one theme for each verb.  The first resource should be the suggestions of players, but if no one has a clear idea, trawl your hard drive and the internet until you find a song that fits.  In this post-Napster era, the best place to download songs that you've already heard is the &lt;a href="http://thepiratebay.org/"&gt;Pirate Bay&lt;/a&gt;.  I have no idea as to the best place to find new, unheard songs.  The only help I can give is all the bookmarks I've put the "sounds" tag on, from least presumed use to most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://cylinders.library.ucsb.edu/index.php"&gt;Cylinder Preservation and Digitization Project&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.magnatune.com/"&gt;Magnatune&lt;/a&gt; (not free)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mikseri.net/users/?id=61143"&gt;Michikawa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ocremix.org/"&gt;OverClocked ReMix&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.vgmix.com/"&gt;VGMix&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/"&gt;Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Now that we have a track list, the goal is to have those tracks be played at the appropriate times.  As I've said, I want to convince players to remember it for me, and the one of the best ways to get players to do something optional is to &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;attach concrete and immediate mechanical benefits to it&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In general, the themes are played when the players call for them, no more than once per session (have a little checklist handy), and give some kind of bonus for as long as they last.  This time limit will encourage the players to focus on whatever kind of action the theme supports, getting as much stuff done with as little side-chat or unrelated actions as possible.  As long as the theme is playing, the bonus will reward players for remaining...in theme!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Specifically, the thematic themes should reward players who take part in their associated verbs, and the character themes should reward players who make that character look awesome.  That will usually be that character's player, but, as I've said, major non-player-controlled characters get them too.  In those cases, the players will still call for the theme to be played, and they'll still get a bonus, as long as they emote sufficient amazement, fear, or in general act impressed with the NPC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, since the plan I've detailed so far is made to work with any system whatsoever, I have no way of detailing these benefits; The specific bonuses will depend on the system.  The tracks should benefit the players somehow, but the specific bonuses will depend entirely on the system.  But then again, I am planning on using this myself with Weapons of the Gods, so I might as well say what my plans are vis-a-vis that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily, WotG already includes a system for gaining a bonus for acting in a certain way.  In general, they are called "Chi Conditions."  Basically, a learned doctor or sneaky courtier or powerful sage diagnoses or causes (in system terms, the two actions are identical) a character to either receive a bonus as long as he is described as acting a certain way, or a penalty as long as he isn't.  Conditions have three different levels of severity.  I'm going to have music be a kind of Minor Condition, the middle level.  These are the different benefits that Minor Chi Conditions can give to characters who follow them (with further context or thoughts in parentheses):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of the Character's Attributes is increased by 2 for the scene.  (Attributes range from 1 to 5 for starting characters, and are storehouses of the Chi used for all kung-fu abilities.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Character receives 1 Destiny whenever following the tenets of the condition gets him in trouble. (Destiny is the game's experience metric.  You could expect, in my game, to receive between four and ten per session.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Character recovers 1 more of a given color of Chi each round (Normally, characters recover only 1 of each Chi per round, so this doubles that...not inconsiderable!)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Character gets +5 on appropriate rolls, or adds +5 to his weapon's Strike.  (As a rule, bonuses don't stack, so players look for the best bonus they can get on a given roll, rather than wasting doing-fun-stuff time looking for &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;every&lt;/span&gt; bonus they can get.  Meaning that players who already have a bonus on rolls won't necessarily bother with the music.  but weapon statistics are an exception.  As you might think, Strike is the "chance to hit" modifier.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Different characters will have kung fu that uses different colors of chi.  That means that a condition that I specify as having the first or third effect, and as giving it to a certain color, will be less useful for some players.  Thus, I think that, since thematic themes should be as inclusive as possible, the fourth option will be best: as long as the characters are participating in the associated verb of the track being played, they have an automatic +5 on all their rolls.  In game terms, they have &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Quality Soundtrack +5&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the themes of major NPCs, I'm going with the second option: Whenever the players narrate their characters being stymied by the efforts and awesomeness of their enemy/rival/"It's complicated," they get a destiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, for the player-controlled character themes, I think that allowing players to customize the effects of their conditions will be fine; it will only be affecting their character, after all.  However, when they may be played and what they may affect will be slightly more limited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Character development in WotG is handled on a divided system:  As I've said, you can gain Destiny from a variety of sources, which are spent to develop knowledge and connections to the setting.  But the only way to rise in Rank in the Martial Arts World, raising the limits on your Attributes and other impressive things, is by doing "Deeds."  Deeds are any action that is both impressive, entertaining the players around the table, and virtuous, in accordance with one of the five xia or five corrupt virtues.  These are Justice, Benevolence, Righteousness, Loyalty and Force, or Revenge, Individualism, Obsession, Ruthlessness and Ferocity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whenever a player's character accomplishes a Deed, the player has the option to have their theme start playing (remember, you can only do it once per session!).  While it's still being heard, the music's benefit applies to anything their character does in accordance with the virtue of the deed that kicked things off.  In short, once per session, a Deed will mark the beginning of a miniature scene which focuses on your character's virtue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which seems like it can actually closely approximate the feeling I get from Coolie's stand against the Axe Gang.  Which should be the standard that I test the results by, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the real problem is being able to rapidly find, among all the music on your computer, songs that fit a given mood and theme.

One which we don't read, &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Clitophon&lt;/span&gt;, is an interesting outlier from the usual narrative of "someone challenges Socrates, Socrates asks what they mean, hours pass, challenger realizes the hidden weakness of his position."  It starts with Socrates remarking, apparently in passing:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"We have recently been informed that Clitophon the son of Aristonymos, in discussion with Lysias, has been criticizing the conversations and speeches of Socrates, while greatly praising the instruction of Thrasymachus."&lt;/blockquote&gt;Very conversational and relaxed in tone.  But in a shocking twist, it turns out the eponymous gentlemen is actually there(?), and immediately leaps to defend himself from a perceived attack, saying:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Whoever told you that, Socrates, misrepresented what I said to Lysias about you.  Though it's true that I didn't praise you for some things, I did praise you for others.  Since you're obviously scolding me right now, though your pretending you don't care, I'd be very glad to tell you myself what I said - especially since we happen to find ourselves alone - so you won't so readily suppose that I have anything against you.  In fact, you probably didn't hear the truth, which is why I think you're being needlessly hard on me.  so if you'd let me speak freely, I'd gladly do so - I want to tell you what I said."&lt;/blockquote&gt;He sounds quite unnecessarily defensive, and I imagine that (and here is where you may inform your meat-computer that the preface is ending and the significant part, such as it is, begins) it is with sadness and reassurance in his tone that Socrates replies:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"By all means; it would be shameful for me not to submit to you when your intention is to help me; for clearly, once I know my good and bad points, I will make it my practice to pursue and develop the former while ridding myself of the latter to the extent that I am able."&lt;/blockquote&gt;Criticism, when accurate, is a favor, and when inaccurate, is nothing.  For too many, criticism has only ever been experienced as a tool for hurt, used by the frustrated, bored and insecure.  Sterile and impotent puppy-kicking.  Now those people live in a world where the slightest correction, the merest hint of assistance is interpreted as a crime, an attack, an unprovoked assault on the self-image and self esteem.  Because as they were raised, criticism came only without productive purpose, now they are incapable of imagining it purposeful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish that this way of treating developing humans could be prosecuted as a felony.  But failing that, we can always laugh those cruel, useless criticizers into humiliation-locked isolation, and act with honest compassion to those capable of being saved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kant said (or didn't, there's some disagreement) that one of the things that all humans owed each other was complete honesty at all times; that there was no possible circumstance when you had a "right" to lie.  Which is silly.  Let us instead say that, to those people towards whom we feel compassion, with whom we feel we suffer together, we have no right to lie.  Compassion is always honest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(The easiest accusation for me to anticipate being leveled at this formulation is that it is insensitive to people's feelings.  That's possible.  I could respond that criticism is voiced best when something more important than sentiment is on the line, but I'm not yet entirely sure whether there is such a thing (another post some day?).  I am sure that I personally don't feel that people who criticize me, whether accurately or inaccurately, cause my feelings to be "hurt."  This leads me to suspect that such reactions in others are learned, rather than innate, and can thus be unlearned with careful (compassionate!) encouragement, but I suppose we'll have to see.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Nick&lt;br /&gt;PS: The worst temptation of the blog (which I have thus far avoided) might be to write there what would be better said to the people they concern.  :)</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2007/10/criticism-honesty-compassion.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/2086266018904339347'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/2086266018904339347'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2007/10/criticism-honesty-compassion.html' title='Criticism, Honesty, Compassion'/><author><name>Nick Novitski</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08863651199447917923</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31707300.post-4941445020304971626</id><published>2007-08-13T20:17:00.001-04:00</published><updated>2009-06-01T22:24:20.267-04:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='art'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='then I had some toast'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='writing'/><title type='text'>First Sighting</title><content type='html'>Hours have passed by unnoticed as I read with keen joy the paperback I purchased reflexively in the five-hour wait of BWI.  Upon finishing, immensely pleased by my savvy choice (&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Accelerando&lt;/span&gt;, and I highly reccomend it), framed by:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The two-dimensional rendering of interlocking four-dimensional white and blue pyramids (American's upholstery of choice) and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The soft brown hair of she who has the window seat, whose profile, when she permits me to see it, grants me almost almost as thin and relaxed a pleasure as the book does,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;I see, in turn (though in an increment of time I am not equipped to distinguish from spontaneity), two things out the airplane window.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;First&lt;/span&gt;: A ribbon of bland concrete brackteted by dark, irregular brush, itself further bracketed by square-edged milk-blue lakes, on the edges of which...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Then&lt;/span&gt;: My eyes saccade and I am now &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;there&lt;/span&gt;, upon that abandoned, misbegotten un-road, bleached and smoothed by the late afternoon sun, reflecting and expelling what heat as it can up in direct lasers into me or indirect thermals gusts around me, such that I feel I am surrounded by the great damp ghost of a half-smothered fire, the sensation of which overrides what heat the sun would seem to provide, except I value my retinas and try to shield them as best I can from the explosions of light that come from all angles, from the water, stewing the tailings of the limestone gravel pit that it once was, in that time of Miami's last (only) export industry, from the unconcerned story-and-a-half-tall warehouse parks, from the things which grow which I am expected to call "trees," from the plane above me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, of course, a moment of self-conscious reflection.  Embarrassment, because I never tire of telling those who don't know what a terrible place Miami is, how it attracts those who have no reason to value the place they live, how the worst of them, the grasping thieving minority, fill the halls of power, and how the worst of them, the ignorant hateful majority, permit it. How it smells bad enough that now I have no sense of smell.  How it is a short-sighted, bawling idiot of a place.  Embarrassment, because faster than I am able to perceive, I found myself imagining and understanding my place in it, found myself &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;there&lt;/span&gt; before I had to be, in a place which I had neither anticipated nor feared nor truly spared a thought for at all, despite deciding to travel there again, after so long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Embarrassment frequently comes to me in the form of this question (which I assiduously attempt to answer): How is it that I permitted this thing to occur?  In this case: What caused/enabled this experience?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was as close as I have come to an &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;artistic&lt;/span&gt; experience.  I sensed without sensing.  I reacted emotionally to a painting I had not painted (and could not paint, of course, I hasten to add).  It got my creative blood up.  On the plane, paperless, I began composing what you read.  Upon landing and having dinner with my mother and father, I was feuertrunken, speaking too loud, too quick, about all the things which I necessarily had planned for the coming school year.  I knew what part of &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;War and Peace&lt;/span&gt; I was going to write my Senior essay on, I knew I needed a laptop to use my spare time to finish the PHP/MySQL/Javascript project so I could use it as a resume to find a job (seeking a good &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;project&lt;/span&gt; rather than a good &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;company&lt;/span&gt;, I explained in detail).  Yesterday, I suddenly had, for the first time, an idea for a short story that is &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;finite&lt;/span&gt; in scope, that I have a hope of finishing.  Art?  Inspiration is the more timid word for it.  I say that art is not an artifact, but a feeling.  "This" substantive thing is never art, though when standing before a thing (in a museum or before a sunset or on a dance floor) which causes you to thrill in ways not easily reducible, you might very well, your head swimming with minute semi-vertigo, the bottom having dropped out under your diaphragm, your every muscle except the one behind your eyes relaxing, breathe:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Ah, Art!"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This happens too, even in Miami, that ugliest duckling, that fevered coke-fiend, that tanned, manicured snake-oil salesman.  But where does it come from? The percolating echoes of all the latin-american theologico-political failures, writ in nightmarishly lurid colors across the broken, jagged canvas of a city that was never good for anything good? The equatorial physics which give us cleansing (but oppressive) rain, clear (though choking) air and an egg-greenish-white sun, combining to result in a quality of light that makes the colors seem to not merely "pop," but leap from their emitters and seek to batter you to the ground, screaming imprecations in their spectrum band?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know the answer.  I should point out that this answer is neccessarily (from my working definition of art) personal.  I will explain it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The high-and-junior-high school I attended, serving the bugaboo of parent donations, hoping to provide students which corresponded to the college admissions junta's latest buzzwords, first set me on the conscious path of "well-rounded education."  We studied a language a week for almost a full year.  We ignited reactive metals.  We shot targets full of arrows.  We disected living objects.  And naturally, we were sent to an "art class."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What did we do there?  All I can remember are the perspective studies.  Take two points on the equator of a large sheet of paper, and remember that surfaces which recede into the distance (&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;into&lt;/span&gt; the paper?!) also compress across the perpendicular north-south paralells.  Draw.  Draw what?  What else did anyone draw except two ways of a four-way intersection, empty, perfectly flat streets flowing between sharp-cornered buildings with more ambiguous windows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's the reason.  Looking through that window, knowing the length of that normal to the surface which passes through me, knowing the angle between that normal and the path my eyes took to that strip of sand-brown-grey-white concrete, I knew &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;exactly&lt;/span&gt; where it was in relation to me, &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;exactly&lt;/span&gt; what it's dimensions were.  The moment of knowing is a moment of perceiving, and location is a function of perception.  Thus, Miami induces Art in me since, barely rising out of the smooth and level ocean on a low mound of warm-rinsed shit, exploding with the green and horrid things which feast upon it and each other, bearing Atlas-like the level cement lattice of geometrically expanding development, it is very, very, very &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;flat&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That constricted view from my constricted seat in our constricted flying machine, that useless appendix of a once-of-note access road, with voracious jungle shrubbery gnawing it into dust, with patient pools of chemically suspect water, is not Miami.  But nonetheless, when I saw it, I was suddenly standing upon it, and looking not back up at my projecting body on the plane like a long-distance doppelganger, but looking &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;around&lt;/span&gt;, and seeing nothing but Miami.  Short, sweaty, poor, arrogant, Miami.  My past, my secret self, my ami, Miami.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Embarrassment ends when an explanation has been found, as with it is found an excuse, an opportunity to say "This is how it occurred, and since the cause does not lie with me, neither does responsibility.  I permitted nothing.  Rather, circumstances used me as a tool to effect events as they wished.  I absolve me."  According to this claim (and evidence supports it), with greater capacity for reason necessarily comes reduced capacity for shame and guilt.  I hope so.  I &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;believe&lt;/span&gt; it, which is to say, I require it of the universe.  This belief makes me eager, just now, to return to (hopefully reason-expanding) school, far from this place, as far as I can ever get while I remain compelled to remind people how little I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dying is forgetting, they say, but I think killing is forgetting too.  Would I die, in that way, to kill Miami? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No.  No, since that would be far too harsh a judgment on my parents, who I love, and on how they happened to raise me, which I am quite partial too.  Time will tell if Miami is indelible, but unlike some, I will not truly seek to destroy the source of my distaste.  I will be from where I am from.  I will hide nothing, and there will be nothing to hide.

The economy of the game requires parity of the number of scenes each player gets, so it was somewhat important who's turn was it, and who was going to fight who on their next turn, but having taken such a long break, remembering anything but who sat to our left and right was basically impossible for me.  Luckily, better heads were present to help, but I learned my lesson; This time, I wrote down what the first three turns of the next session will be. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried out two new wrinkles to the hack&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first was the replacement of Dirty Tactics with Special Attack, resulting in two changes, one mechanical.  The first change is adding a step to creating the monster: Now you need a base animal, a color pattern, an unusual feature _and_ a special attack.  The other is turned out to be problematic... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Contenders, a boxing match runs round by round, with each player deciding ahead of time whether he'll fight carefully, heedlessly, balanced, or dirty.  Fighting Dirty gives you a mechanical advantage, with the risk that if your opponent wins narration for the round(base 50/50 chance, adjusted for how many more cards than you he has drawn), he can narrate the ref noticing the cheap shot and awarding him a free victory point.  Since the fiction I'm proposing doesn't really have a place for the concept of rule-breaking, I thought to make it simply cost a point of Conditioning.  Long story short, this seems to have been a mistake.  Right now, having spoken with Daniel (far better than I at game-system considerations), I'm going to try having it cost Technique next session.  Technique seems overpowered in the game, just like so many otherwise sensible dexterity-like statistics before it.  I'm not sure if this change will help things, but it'll be interesting to see what happens. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This all reminds me, I intended to change the the boxer stat names of Contenders to more thematically appropriate fighty-monster stats.  Right now I'm thinking: Technique becomes Energy, your ability to use your awesome powers to control the action of the round.  Strength becomes Ferocity, the degree to which the normally reticent monsters have developed a killing/mauling instinct.  Cover becomes Resilience, the difficulty your opponent has in hurting you.  Conditioning (tentatively) becomes Konjo, the resolve to keep going beyond all reasonable limits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the second alteration occurred to me during play.  Nate wanted to use a training scene to raise "Princess'" conditioning.  He said, "Princess is pretty fast, but she isn't big enough.  Tatyana buys a bunch of steak, so she'll grow big and strong!"  He was half-joking, as usual, but this clicked with an earlier idle thought I had about the place of "evolution" in the fighty-monster aesthetic. So I came up with this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every time a stat is raised, describe a new aspect of the monster's appearance that appeared in the course of training.  This can be a change of color scheme, an additional tail, venom dripping from his slavering jaws, whatever.  Gradually, your monster goes from "it's kinda a dinosaur" to "it's a 20-foot tall dinosaur with spikes on its tail and cannons on its back and etc." &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're only maybe a session away from endgame (damn Daniel and his successful fighting!), so we probably won't see this come into effect very much.  In fact, we've only had two or three training scenes each in the game, so maybe this evolution stuff will have too little effect to be worth it.  Still, I think I like the idea of the monsters starting off as childhood companions, then gradually growing into the role of fighting-thingys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Playability note: Nate had difficulty deciding on changes to his monster (at first he tried to just say, again and again, that she got bigger).  This is part of a pattern: Not being sure what the monster's base design would be, not being sure what her special attack would be, etc.  When Daniel and I suggested possibilities, they didn't appeal to him, so it wasn't just a case of disconnect...I think lots of people can have that problem, but I don't know how to solve it yet, except with a long list of possibilities/examples.  That might be enough, but I'm not sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We shall see!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Nick</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2007/07/contenders-fighty-monsters-hack-pt-2.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/7083181988272186715'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/7083181988272186715'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2007/07/contenders-fighty-monsters-hack-pt-2.html' title='Contenders Fighty-Monsters Hack pt. 2'/><author><name>Nick Novitski</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08863651199447917923</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31707300.post-4962148383202507663</id><published>2007-06-18T23:11:00.001-04:00</published><updated>2009-06-01T22:24:20.268-04:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='art'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='then I had some toast'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='writing'/><title type='text'>Ireland, One Year After</title><content type='html'>Last summer I visited Ireland with Hiro.

That process therefore has inherent, creative and ideological value...The more we blog, the more we reflect, the more we think and write about learning and our practices as professional educators, the smarter we're all going to get! Dr. Stephen Krashen, Emeritus Professor at the University of Southern California, confirms this conclusion is supported by &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=1591581699%26tag=discoveringharry%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/1591581699%253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002"&gt;educational research&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/blockquote&gt;And, from that research itself:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Although writing does not help us develop writing style [Krashen contends READING develops writing style], writing has other virtues. As Smith (1988) has pointed out, we write for at least two reasons. First, and most obvious, we write to communicate with others. But perhaps more important, we write for ourselves, to clarify and stimulate our thinking. Most of our writing, even if we are published authors, is for ourselves.&lt;br /&gt;As Elbow (1973) has noted, it is difficult to hold more than one thought in mind at a time. When we write our ideas down, the vague and abstract become clear and concrete. When thoughts are on paper, we can see the relationships among them, and can come up with better thoughts. Writing, in other words, can make you smarter.&lt;/blockquote&gt;As the ITM points out, this might be the best reason for everyone and anyone to blog.  I know it's what convinced me to start.  Admittedly, I do more than my share of cutting and pasting (c.f. above), but I like to think there's enough intelligent processing and commentary being added that I end up formulating more sophisticated responses than otherwise.  My tiny corner of the "participation culture."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But of course, that and other buzzwords conveniently forgets those people uninterested in reflection or participation.  Which is understandable: Inasmuch as they don't participate, they aren't part of any dialogue on participation.  What do we do about them?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all likelihood, nothing.  If it were up to me, schools nationwide would inculcate in their students principles of free thought and conversation.  But barring that, those who are without the loop will continue to just sit there while we go off and live our bizarre digital lives, making amazing and beautiful things like &lt;a href="http://icanhascheezburger.com/"&gt;pictures of kittens with amusing captions&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="http://www.somethingawful.com/d/news/internet-quotes.php"&gt;bitter ironic commentary&lt;/a&gt;.</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2007/06/writing-makes-you-smarter-reading-makes.html#comment-form' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/380293665093290704'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/380293665093290704'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2007/06/writing-makes-you-smarter-reading-makes.html' title='Writing makes you smarter, Reading makes you a better writer'/><author><name>Nick Novitski</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08863651199447917923</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31707300.post-3866733074505518653</id><published>2007-06-18T16:06:00.000-04:00</published><updated>2007-06-18T16:14:02.203-04:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='gaming'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='neologism'/><title type='text'>Gleemax: WotC's New Online Initiative</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;From&lt;a href="http://icv2.com/articles/home/10725.html"&gt;ICv2 News:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wizards of the Coast has unveiled ambitious plans to construct a "next generation" online home for hobby gamers--an initiative that will focus on building a gaming community (including tools for hobby retailers), providing editorial content that supports hobby gaming, and offering games of interest to that audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, &lt;a href="http://gleemax.com/"&gt;Gleemax.com&lt;/a&gt; does nothing but look bad in Firefox.  Someday, it will do a great deal.  Offer social blogging for both players and professionals.  Find stores, gamers and events in your area.  Sell games.  Let you review those games.  Dragon Magazine + Amazon.com + one of Livejournal, Myspace or Facebook = &lt;a href="http://www.gleemax.com/"&gt;Gleemax&lt;/a&gt;.  But which one of those social networking sites will it most resemble?  That is, what will the target demographic be, and therefore, what sort of culture and atmosphere may we expect from fellow users?  Frat-boy Halo players?  Gen Y Pokemon players?  All-ages Yahoo flash games players?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;WotC feels that it has identified a psychographic profile of the hobby gamer that is different from videogame players, and &lt;a href="http://www.gleemax.com/"&gt;Gleemax&lt;/a&gt; is designed to appeal to that psychographic and recruit new members to the hobby gaming community which in the past was populated almost exclusively through core hobby stores. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;They have probably spent more money on 'psychographic' studies than I will earn in three lifetimes, so I'm already listening.  In the &lt;a href="http://www.icv2.com/articles/news/10687.html"&gt;linked interview&lt;/a&gt;, "VP of Digital Games" Randy Buehler elaborates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="text"&gt;&lt;span class="text"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I don't know what the word is to refer to online strategy gamers plus tabletop gamers.  I've been using "hobby gamers" to try and capture all that, but I'm not sure we have the right word that would cover the whole audience yet.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;So basically, people who play games, in the broadest sense.  Experience makes me lean towards thinking most computer-mediated games are a lot a cross between juggling and watching a movie.  Fun, but not having fun with other people.  I might be missing a point, and the terminology definitely needs to be hammered out, but my experience accords with their psycho-whoosit study.  Like in this part:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our read on the core hobby industry is that it's stable, but it's aging," WotC VP of Digital Games Randy Buehler told us.  "We're slowing down in terms of recruiting that next generation of hobby gamers.  Today's 15-year-olds have such a different experience than a 15-year-old did five years ago or 10 years ago, or when I was a 15-year-old.  So today's 15-year-old is online and doesn't necessarily have any reason to leave his computer because there's so much to do there."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's what I've seen too, except that in plenty of markets all the card games that aren't &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Magic&lt;/span&gt; (i.e., &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Yugioh&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Pokemon&lt;/span&gt; et al.) go like gangbusters.  Is it possible this report is centered on Wizards of the Coast/Hasbro products?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We obviously spent a lot of time studying our player base, and it's not just the &lt;i style=""&gt;Magic &lt;/i&gt;player base.  &lt;i style=""&gt;D&amp;D &lt;/i&gt;is a huge part of our business and we spent a lot of time studying trends and what we think is going on in the industry.  Our research, both our internal data and our market research shows us that we're not recruiting as many teenagers as we were five years ago.  I guess we're assuming that's true of the whole industry -- we make up enough of the industry that if it's true of us it might be true of everybody.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Hehn.  Not really, of course.  In fact, the more one company dominates their sector, the less significant that company's data becomes for others in it.  Inasmuch as a small company would be surviving at all in such a condition, it would have to be offering something significantly different from the dominating company.  If I'm &lt;a href="http://www.lumpley.com/dogs.html"&gt;Vincent Baker&lt;/a&gt;, there's a limit to how much the demographics of &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&lt;/span&gt; players affects my business.  If their sales drop by 30% and mine rise by 300%, the net effect would be thousands of people dropping out of the hobby altogether, but by now, we should have learned from the juggernaut rise of online "casual" gaming that games can be made to appeal to humans, not just gamers, and there's plenty of board and role-playing successes along those lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking of all this bizarre indie alterna-gaming, will we even be able to talk about it on this funky new site?  Survey says: Yes, and that's not all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But &lt;i style=""&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.gleemax.com/"&gt;Gleemax&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/i&gt;won't be a "WotC Only" zone, as WotC's Randy Buehler told ICv2 &lt;a href="http://www.gleemax.com/"&gt;&lt;i style=""&gt;Gleemax&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; will be: "a home for gamers brought to you by Wizards of the Coast, but not controlled by Wizards of the Coast." WotC will let competitors set up in the social network space and will allow criticism of WotC and its products as well. To foster this independence WotC is setting up a &lt;a href="http://www.gleemax.com/"&gt;&lt;i style=""&gt;Gleemax.com&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Advisory Board that will include "industry thought leaders" and WotC is holding an open casting call to fill three gamer spots on the board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So Wizards of the Coast is spending millions of dollars to get hundreds of thousands of people to know about YOUR game.  They're gathering an audience and creating a community, and as an aside, they're creating a new distribution channel as well.  Kudos to them for not being evil!  By keeping it open, they've managed to avoid a major chance to shoot themselves in the foot.  It's almost as if they are genuinely trying to foster a healthy and open community!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think the draw is the community. We think the first thing you want people to run into is other people. The games are secondary in our opinion. The right way to grow the hobby industry is to invest in hobby gamers; it's to invest in people and community. If those conversations are interesting and those friendships start to form, we all win in the long run. I really think the community content is the gateway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So there you have it.  The psychographics don't lie: The advantage of tabletop, the distinction of "hobby," it's all about playing with things we recognize as human, generating positive social feedback.  The internet may be, as I have known others to say, a steaming pile when it comes to forming calm, informed consensus, but it's not terrible for making friends, or promoting things, or selling things.

After they had agreed to play the game at all, I asked them if they were interested in testing my idea for a pokemon/my-pet-monster inspired setting.  They agreed to that as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's a couple of 'system' changes that are simple enough: The out-of-ring stats become connected to the "kid" half of the character, and the in-ring traits belong to the monster.  Monsters are created by naming an animal, one or two principal colors, and one distinct unusual feature.  They are not played by their creator, but by the player to that person's right.  They resemble younger siblings in character, looking to the kid as a guide to making their way and how to interact with things, being generally trusting and sometimes questioning.  They should learn from whatever they see done.  Their player should use this to highlight the moral weight of the characters actions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part of my ultimate goal for the design is to make it approachable and encouraging to kids, an opportunity for younger and older players to safely confront moral issues and tell the kind of happy/depressing stories that Contenders enables.  However, since I was playing with "adults" this time, I asked them if they wanted to leave the table open to the bad stuff.  We decided the game would be set in the more-or-less real world, in Prague.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I played Robert, a young Midwesterner with a penchant for dinosaurs, and a very sick mommy.   His monster is Pyrosaur, a lime raptor with fire-breath.  Daniel played Pyrosaur, and Calvin, a tempermental Bostonian trying to save his parish church with the help of Mickey, a black-and-red-feathered wyvern.  Mickey was played by Nate, along with Tatiana, an orphan whose blue-black leopard Princess had freed from her horrific state-run orphanage, and who is now fighting for the money to be able to live with all her friends in a big house and be safe for ever and ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'd only played six scenes, culminating in one fight, before we had to stop for the night (the game was called on account of Game 2 in the NBA Finals, which I can hear down the hall as I write this).  Fun stuff, but obviously too little to go on for a fully informed opinion, either about &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Contenders&lt;/span&gt; or my mod.  So far though, the only hitch I've noticed is what I assumed would happen in a game with only three people: character overload.  The two promotion scenes were the worst offenders, as we had the spotlight player's kid, his monster, the challenged kid, &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;his&lt;/span&gt; monster and the promoter.  Hard to keep straight.  Four players would have been a lot better, I think.  But the innocence of the kids and the sheer physicality and inadvertent deadlines of the monsters made for some fun story meat.  Twelve and fourteen-year-olds finding (and failing!) work in the Czech underworld was a lot less ridiculous than I was worried it would seem.  The game gives them a mission and a reason to be going into that underworld, after all. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Robert failed his first job for a mobster named Dmitri, learning to dislike and mistrust cops, then cleverly stole some drugs, "to make up for the last time," giving him the money his parents need to stay in the hospice they've moved into.  Calvin had a much more violent mistake in his also-botched first job for local Irish-boy-done "good" Samuel when Mickey broke a storefront too enthusiastically, fatally cutting a worker with flying glass, then taking Sam's goon's head off when the guy tried to stop them from fleeing the scene.  Tatiana went straight for the meat with the aforementioned bout, getting an impressive debut victory in a filthy underground circuit run by a mysterious man named Olaf, against the emigre Johann and his feelthy monkey Makek.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm very much looking forward to continuing things on Wednesday.  I think that I'll start with giving Pyrosaur some endurance training, and then Calvin and Mickey will fight semi-verteran Jiro and his chainsaw-mantis Yoshi in Olaf's pit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can't wait till I get to narrate a fight!  That looked like &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;fun&lt;/span&gt;.  I'm really pleased that Daniel and Nate enjoyed it.</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2007/06/contenders-fighty-monsters-hack.html#comment-form' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/2988369242905194807'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/2988369242905194807'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2007/06/contenders-fighty-monsters-hack.html' title='Contenders Fighty-Monsters hack'/><author><name>Nick Novitski</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08863651199447917923</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31707300.post-7281879884610131751</id><published>2007-06-08T14:00:00.000-04:00</published><updated>2007-06-08T13:06:52.511-04:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='earthwatchr'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='neologism'/><title type='text'>Earthwatchr Launch</title><content type='html'>Today sees the launch of something that I'm very proud of.: The Jane Goodall Institute's new &lt;a href="http://www.janegoodall.org/gombe-chimp-blog/"&gt;Gombe Chimpanzee Research Blog&lt;/a&gt;, using the &lt;a href="http://earthwatchr.org/"&gt;Earthwatchr geoblogging software&lt;/a&gt; that I am half the programming team for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you go to the site, you can see Earthwatchr integrates google maps, google earth, and your website into a single experience.

Yesterday, the person whose account it actually is checked out under asked me if I had finished it yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Uh.  Not even a little bit," I said.  I felt bad about this, since I hadn't spent the time on it that I had wanted to, since I had gotten really involved in making Earthwatchr and reading &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;War &amp; Peace&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;del&gt;&lt;/del&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Well, it's due," he said, and asked if I could please turn it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has prompted me to return that copy, buy another for two dollars from Ebay (Hooray &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/products"&gt;&lt;del&gt;Froogle&lt;/del&gt;Google Product Search&lt;/a&gt;!), and wrap up my summary and commentary for the first chapter, which had been languishing since a week after my last post on the subject.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as format, I've tried to use the summary of the text itself as a skeleton on which to hang far-ranging, pie-in-the-sky speculation.  I don't want to get married to any particular mechanics until I've well and truly finished the book, but now is the time for brainstorming without an eye towards consequences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fair warning:  This is long.  Read only if you're intrigued by the idea, and have time to sit and read for a bit.  Or know how to set bookmarks and read web pages over multiple sessions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hey, some of my friends claim that they can't.  Or possibly, people who say they can't claim to be my friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, each chapter begins with quotes which are awesome enough to include in full, even in this case, when I'm repeating myself in part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;To this war of everyman, against everyman, this also is consequent; that nothing can be unjust.  The notions of right and wrong, justice and injustice have there no place.  Where there is no common power, there is no law; where no law, no injustice.  Force, and fraud, are in war the two cardinal virtues. ... It is consequent also to the condition, that there be no propriety, no commission, no mine and thine distinct; but only that to be every man's, that he can get; and for so long, as he can keep it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: right;"&gt;Thomas Hobbes, &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?vid=0joszX3cwBDDvWxTXAoDBt6&amp;id=pYwNAAAAIAAJ&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;pg=PA1&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;amp;dq=intitle:Leviathan+inauthor:thomas+inauthor:hobbes&amp;as_brr=1#PPR11,M1"&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Leviathan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Based on the name I gave to this project, you might rightfully assume that Hobbes' work was in my thoughts when I conceived it.  It bothered me how forcefully people in my class rejected it, for emotional reasons which they didn't bother to examine.  I hypothesized a (ahem) genius undervalued in his life time, who was so frustrated by the world's resistance to the change that would be brought on by widespread adoption of his self-organizing nanorobot swarms, that he secretly launched a pod into space that gradually grew into his greatest design, a sentient space station that would, in return for the protection and opportunity it offered, force the inhabitants to address what it saw as the true nature of humans and human society.  Which bore some small resemblance to Hobbes'.   So it makes a place where, to get anything done, you need to band with others to make a microcosm of a state, or corporation, or gang.  &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Snow Crash&lt;/span&gt; crossed with &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Logan's Run&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose that, after I finish noting up &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Islands&lt;/span&gt;,  if I wanted to really delay doing actual work on the game, I could re-read &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?vid=0joszX3cwBDDvWxTXAoDBt6&amp;id=pYwNAAAAIAAJ&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;pg=PA1&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;amp;dq=intitle:Leviathan+inauthor:thomas+inauthor:hobbes&amp;as_brr=1#PPR11,M1"&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Leviathan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  It's long, but there's plenty of parts ("On the Kingdom of Darknesse," say) I could probably skip.  Hobbes does have a systemic view of human qualities and conflicts that lends itself to the realm of games.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like, for instance, Force and Fraud.  It's a pleasing dichotomy, separating almost all human interactions into two distinct realms of ability.  They are excellent candidates for traits of some kind.  In fact, given the way they match each other perfectly, they could be two separate traits that can increase separately, or a single number in a range that one needs to roll above for Force (say,) and below for Fraud, thus making ability in one debility in the other, a la Ron Edwards' &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Trollbabe&lt;/span&gt;.  Which I need to buy, someday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As well, this quote reminds me that I want cards to change owners frequently.  I never was very good at &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Magic: The Gathering&lt;/span&gt;, but I watched a lot of games.  I noticed that the real game (that is, what determined victory and loss) wasn't the play you saw at the table, but the design of the decks, which happened mostly outside of the shared experience.  The result was: To be a successful player, you had to be a less entertaining player.  In a roleplaying game, this should be exactly reversed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To take &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;shock:&lt;/span&gt; as an ideal, development of the cards/deck should be linked to cool things happening in play, by which I mean success or failure of significant conflicts.  This rewards both action and fiction, and assists in attaching the player to the character(s).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The inhabitant of the United States learns from birth that he must rely on himself to combat the ills and trials of life; he is restless and defiant in his outlook toward the authority of society and appeals to its power only when he cannot do without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: right;"&gt;Alexis de Tocqueville, &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?vid=0_BaW-gWW5huGIXuOkzyZ9&amp;id=e8IOEkLM6KsC&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;pg=PA1&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;amp;dq=intitle:democracy+intitle:america+inauthor:tocqueville&amp;as_brr=1#PPA1,M1"&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Democracy in America&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I once vaguely described the conditions which Leviathan induces on his inhabitants to a curious friend.  "Like America, then," was the most memorable part of response.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More to the point, one of my working mechanical assumptions currently is that conflicts always center around just two participants.  One player, the attacker, plays a card with a character on it and names a target, which is another player's card, either a character or property.  The defending player plays that named card.  Then, players take turns putting down cards that are in some way linked to the cards already in play.  In essence, individuals try to accomplish something, and ask other individuals whom they have genuine connections to, to help.  Past some number of degrees of separation, the friend of a friend is probably not worth calling on.  "The Police" or "the Government," being themselves gangs or alliances of gangs, are not to be relied on without the same  consideration of cost and value found in any other exchange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The summary of the text follows, indented and italicized, interspersed with reactions, commentary and speculation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Previous theories of gang phenomena are inadequate at explaining...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The behavior of individuals in gangs,&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The behavior of gangs as groups, and&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why gangs thrive or decline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Jankowski's theory is composed of three principal parts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Who joins gangs,&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How gangs are organized, and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How gangs and other organizations and institutions interact.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Honestly, it wasn't Jankowski quoting Leviathan that convinced me I needed to read his book.  Reading these two paragraphs in google's search preview, I saw that his theory covered precisely what points I saw as required of a game that featured "gangs!" as a vague design goal. Namely, a determination of:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;What the characters have in common, and what distinguishes them,&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What gangs have in common, and what distinguishes them,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How characters fit into and contribute towards the gang's shared goals, and how they conflict with each other over influencing those goals,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How the gangs as groups conflict with each other, and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What strategies are viable in these conflicts&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;blockquote style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Why do gangs emerge?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not, as most say, due to a desire for order or safety not satisfied in depressed neighborhoods.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Low-income areas are actually quite organized, specifically around competition for scarce resources.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gangs are one possible organizational response seeking to improve the competitive advantages of its members.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;It's possible that, if I were to generalize this game idea beyond the setting I've always imagined it in, other settings would probably be most vividly and immediately defined by first saying "In this world, what resource is being fought over?"  Money, respect, land, heismann trophies...each of these defines a world, or at least a dimension of it.  Since we can imagine the reason people might want those things, we can imagine the kind of people who would be fighting over them, and the ways they might do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imagine five people get together to play Leviathan.  They take out a sheet a bit like the grid from shock:, and each fill in one space in the first column, without any real consultation with each other, such that we end up with with the varied responses:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Courtly Power and Position&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Longevity Drug&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Commerce&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Water&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Future of Human Evolution&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;It is a rule decreed from on high that &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;there are groups competing fiercely for each of these things, somewhere in the setting&lt;/span&gt;.  These groups might be separated or conjoined in any number of ways.  That is, it is possible that the courtly inhabitants of the world duel and machinate to raise their family's position and coffers, both of which no doubt stem from some control of immortality, while secret cabals lurking in the background fight shadow wars for the right to decide the fate of the creature called Man, while fierce tribes in one forgotten corner war against each other and the cruel, uncaring desert for survival, with mutual unconcern between them and the rest.  For each game, or week or series of games, a single aspect is chosen to be spotlit.  "In this fictional world, people fight over all these things.  Any of them might influence this story, but &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;this thing&lt;/span&gt; is what we will be focusing on and fighting over right now."  The ensuing games focus on the battles to control that resource.  Victory in them entails the gang gaining more of that resource.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can resources be traded with others, and/or with the bank by a fixed ratio, Settlers of Catan Style?  Can a rate of exchange be tied to the way that, in the fiction, an amount of a given resource gives you more of another?  Commerce can get you water, but can water get you influence at court?  Should we just have, for each resource, an array [Resources this Resource Can Be Traded In For]?  Should we need to rank them, as in, one can be traded for any other, the next can be traded for any other but the first, and so on until the end?  Or is a web to be sought rather than a hierarchy, with Water being traded for the Drug, which can be traded for Evolutionary Future, which can be traded for Position, though Water-&gt;Position be impossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 1: The above!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 2: !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 3: Dune!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note to self:  Work on step 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Gang members have what Jankowski calls the &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Defiant Individualist&lt;/span&gt; character, a complex of seven principal traits...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Competitiveness&lt;/span&gt;, since as a child, he competed with siblings for space and affection&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Mistrust&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Wariness&lt;/span&gt;, since competition teaches him that trust is a calculation, not a given (though this does not inhibit organization)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Self-Reliance&lt;/span&gt;, since the assistance available to him is limited, and never without cost&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Social Isolation&lt;/span&gt;, since emotional attachment is a hindrance to self-reliance, reducing his options and increasing the odds of getting hurt&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Survival Instinct&lt;/span&gt;, since competitive environments make for predatory inhabitants, which he observes and imitates, if he wishes to survive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Social Darwinist World-View&lt;/span&gt;, since comparing his neighborhood with the wider world shows him that successful people tend to have the previous traits, lending him confidence in his rightness and fitness to survive and succeed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Defiant Air&lt;/span&gt;, both giving few indications of deference, fear or remorse, and having the private resolve to continue despite the obstacles and abuse they encounter, and any suggestion that are not up to the challenge&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;At first blush, there are two ways this list can be used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, some or all of these traits might correspond to characteristics.  That is, players might accumulate Mistrust points, roll their Defiance or Competitiveness when in conflict with one another, be grouped in ranks or levels according to principles of Social Darwinism, or who-knows-what-else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, this can be the required structure of the back story for any character.  That is, the character's past must include, in order, descriptions of how he struggled with other children, how he learned that he couldn't always trust people, how he learned assistance always has a price, how he found emotional attachment to be painful or disadvantageous, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, these two ways are not contradictory.  One is reminded of the phases of character generation in &lt;a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://www.evilhat.com/?spirit"&gt;Spirit of the Century&lt;/a&gt;, where each hero describes a part of his life, then selects two corresponding "aspects," which are words or phrases that the player can refer to in a conflict to boost his characters chances for success.  So a player might describe how his engineer-character spent a hellish four years in the middle of the Great War, but surviving against all odds, selecting the aspects "Trench Warfare" and "Surviving against all odds."  Now, whenever the expertise these aspects refer to might come in handy to the character, the player is allowed greater control of the narrative along those lines.  So, applied to the current situation, a player gives a couple of sentences about his character's childhood, and whatever led him to mistrust, and names a trait related to that specific kind and/or degree of mistrust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Variations in Defiant Individualism exist, and are linked to ethnicity.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Perfect.  Clades, tribes, cultures.  In my opinion, &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Magic&lt;/span&gt; was really boring before types and tribes and nations of creatures and spells showed up.  I remember reading an article (I &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;think&lt;/span&gt; by Rich Wulf) talking about how when the card game &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Legend of the Five Rings&lt;/span&gt; was being developed, the various character cards weren't...well, weren't characters.  They didn't have names at first, just descriptions, like in Magic.  It was all "Headstrong Crane Clan Duelist" and "Ambitious Dragon Clan Soldier" and "Disgraced Lion Clan General."  But then the art came in, and they looked at it, and suddenly the descriptors had become personalizations.  These were people, not cards.  The designers knew there was a story behind each of them, even though it hadn't been written yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want guidelines for players to make cards with soul.  I want them to be alive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is backstory, in &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;L5R&lt;/span&gt;?  It is that aspect of a card/character which is not determined by the player.  It is everything that is not "how you use it".  The characters live because we hear tell of their lives, we receive knowledge of their deeds as time passes, just as .  "Soul" and "Life" are words for "I believe this thing has motives independent from mine."  How would cards created by the players themselves possess that?  Characters live when some part of them is outside your control.  What part can be outside of their control?  Whose control would that part instead be under?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Successful individuals rationally calculate...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Culture, both as an object to be preserved and as an action that dictates appropriate or desirable goals, and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Emotions, or the display of emotions, either as a resource or weakness, depending on the situation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Jankowski seems to note this as a reminder for people who are unused to thinking this way.  It reminds me a bit of the "System Matters" essay.  That is, I can make the game I want by making rules that reward the behaviors I want, and require the situations I want.  So I probably would like to make a game where considering Culture and Emotions into rational strategic calculations is rewarded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote style="font-style: italic;"&gt;An individual's level of Defiant Individualism is a function of...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The number of traits they exhibit, and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The intensity to which they exhibit them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Most members of low-income communities share some of these traits (competitiveness, mistrust), but gang members will display more, and with a greater intensity, which is why they have joined the gang.  Successful gangs must manage this.&lt;/blockquote&gt;I'm reminded of &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Trollbabe&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Polaris&lt;/span&gt;.  In &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Polaris&lt;/span&gt;, two numbers called Light and Ice indicate your ability in common action and lonesome action, respectively (if that sounds loosely defined, that's cuz it do be).  In &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Trollbabe&lt;/span&gt;, you have one stat, that you try to roll over to succeed in physical tasks and under to succeed in magical tasks.  Combining the two, the more capable a character is in direct action, the more tenuously he is tied to the group, and the more difficult for the player to control, or at least get benefit from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It might be frustrating for real-life gang leaders to herd murderous, drug-dealing cats.  It should not be frustrating for game-life gang leaders to do the same.  Having your characters actions dictated to you, or not being able to dictate them, can be frustrating.  I think that this Defiant Individualism could be key to making the game flavorful, but it that it needs to be handled with some tact and discretion to make sure that success and failure are both interesting.  I presume, for the time being, a relevant number stat that all characters have.  When one influences another, the higher their total influence stat, the easier (less costly) the action is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote style="font-style: italic;"&gt;The definition of a Gang&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is an organized social system.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is quasi-private, not fully open to the public.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is quasi-secretive, with much information concerning its business remaining confined within the group.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Its size and goals have necessitated that social intercourse be governed by a leadership structure that has defined roles.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The authority associated with these roles has been legitimized to the extent that social codes are operational to regulate the behavior of both the leadership and the rank and file.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It plans and provides not only for the social and economic services of its members, but also for its own maintenance as an organization.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It pursues such goals irrespective of whether the action is legal or not.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It lacks a bureaucracy, an administrative staff that is hierarchically organized and separate from leadership.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Woo!  What a rush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have, in this package, a fragment of a design document.  Why are social institutions not called gangs?  Obviously, due to the last two of these requirements.  Thus, one of my goals in designing a setting populated only by such groups, or giving guidelines for others to design one, must be: "No significant groups within in the bounds of play consider legalities a moral concern, and none maintain a bureaucracy."  By bounds, I suppose I mean "the setting, in practice."  That is, for a random example, imagine some kind of prison setting, maybe a planet or dimension or Underdark-like cave-system (&lt;a href="http://www.spidweb.com/"&gt;Avernum&lt;/a&gt; is the greatest CRPG you've never played) or something, it's reasonable to think that the maintainers of such a jail have some kind of  bureaucracy.  In which case, they have nothing to do with the action of the players.  They're not even backdrop, they're the brick wall behind the backdrop.  The world contains them, but the effective setting, the bounds of play, does not.  There should be a better word for what I'm talking about, since I've experienced multiple conversations where the word "setting" led to confusion, but if there is, I don't know it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Gang Membership is a negotiation between the Individual and the Organization&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Individual wants to join because he assumes that chances of finding opportunities to improve the quality of his life will increase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Organization only wants members of a quality and number such that it can maintain...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Its prestige,&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The efficiency of its operations, and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The level of services to its members considered adequate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;The ability of the gang to retain members is dependent on it's capacity to provide them with assets: Entertainment, protection, and monetary or material wealth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This capacity is dependant on its economic efficiency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This efficiency is dependant on its proficiency at...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Planning activities,&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mobilizing its resources (including human resources),&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Creating new resources,&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Executing its plans successfully, and&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Controlling its market (degree of monopoly).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;The ability to effect these things is dependant on its capacity to establish legitimacy in its authority structure.   This is done by giving the rank and file membership leadership equal to or better than their expectations, and an acceptable method of handling leadership change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ability to establish legitimacy is dependant on its capacity to...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Manage its members defiant individualism, by imposing discipline but not control, and allowing individuals the freedom to pursue some of their personal goals, and&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Create cooperation through obligation, either through interest incentives (the individual feels he receives some return on his cooperation), moral incentives (the individual believes his gang participation is an agreement between him and the other members which he is obligated to uphold), and organizational rules (the individual understands and accepts a set of rules, either fearfully or rationally).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Did you follow all that?  If you look at only the first and last terms of the equation, you see that the success of a gang depends on &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; forcing ironclad control of your members, and on effectively rewarding them, brainwashing them, and/or systematizing rules and punishments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is there a way for the points of contact between player and system to be ones of influence and not control?  All that seems necessary for that is for characters to have simple default behaviors which can be overridden via the expenditure of a limited resource.  Typically, the default behaviors of cards is to do nothing unless directed, and the number of directions or orders that you give is limited by your cards, not the rules.  So we want cards to do more than nothing, and for players to only be able to do less than everything (presuming this influence thing pans out, I mean).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lets say there are a fixed number of traits that character cards can have.  As with most card games, these traits each contain a special rule that applies to their bearers, overriding the default rules to their advantage.  For example, in &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Magic&lt;/span&gt;, when one player's creatures attack another player, they either damage that player, or he selects one of his own creatures to be damaged.  However, if the attacking creature has the trait &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Flight&lt;/span&gt;, then they can only be "blocked" by other creatures with the same trait.  The rules are overridden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what if those traits &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; contained both a favorable rule, &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;and a default behavior&lt;/span&gt;?  Every advantage would be linked to a disadvantage, a compulsion that, while it could be overridden by the expenditure of a leader's resources, could also be manipulated by an enemy.  Cf, Sonny Corleone gets killed because his reaction to certain news can be predicted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite my italics, this isn't really a new idea.  In &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Exalted&lt;/span&gt;, or any of White Wolf's other games, there's a kind of trait called Backgrounds, which are each resources that the character posesses that are not inherently a part of him.  Secretly, this means that they must be managed: They can be stolen or kidnapped or tricked, they can ask you for help or favor, they demand respect or responsibility or attention.  The result is that the GM has an immense toolbox with which to engage the player.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what I would do is have everyone be the "players" of their own characters, and adversarial -type "GMs" to their opponents.   Whatever typifies those two types of play also typifies offense and defense in this theoretical structure.  Winning is a matter of learning how they relate and feed into one another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, it's a nice dream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Strong internal cohesion and efficiency is not sufficient to ensure the survival of a gang.  It must be integrated into both the local and larger community&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Local Community:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gangs must not only avoid antagonizing residents, but persuade them to consider the gang members "their own."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To this end, they must be respectful in interactions with residents, avoid preying on them, insulting them, or harrassing them in any way.  Also, they must provide residents with help when the occasion arises, in the form of protection, manpower, giving financial assistance, or providing shelter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gang depends on the support of the community if it is to be protected from rival predators.  It is similar to a local militia, in that it responds to the needs of the community, rather than taking a lead to set the agenda of the community.&lt;/blockquote&gt;That last part gave me pause, at first.  I had imagined these groups as possibly being tribes, with a complete social system, or the crews of their privately-owned spaceships, not connected to any particular social system, and this suggests that they must always be subsections of some immediate community.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But on further reflection, this is no restriction at all.  In any tribe, there will be some who drive conflict with other tribes, and some who provide a context or meaning for that conflict.  The crew of &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Firefly&lt;/span&gt; might be a kind of sealed-off little world, but it still must survive in the real world around it, and that includes not antagonizing the people or powers of that world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Larger Community:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This primarily includes linkages with&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Local Government,&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Criminal Justice System, and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Media.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People who operate within each of these institutions periodically determine that exchange relationships with gangs may be beneficial either to their ability to carry out their personal responsibilities, or to their organization's ability to execute the function it is charged with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are of two types of such relationships, based on two possible origins&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Representatives of one group initiate contact with the other with a proposition.  The chances this relationship succeeding depend on the type of service needed, the resources necessary from each party, and the track record each has in providing the service, or services in general.  Either way, in general, it will be temporary and not very stable.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The relationship emerges naturally when an institution or organization has consistent contact with the gang.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;So, here is a way in which setting/system elements which are not, in fact, gangs, may be included in a game of gangs.  Or it's a way in which multiple gangs can have beneficial relations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part of a definition of a particular group/gang/tribe should probably be "This is what we have more of than anyone else, and people who want it have to either make a deal with us, or just deal with us.  This is what we have to offer."  Even the poorest gang has an in with it's community, eyes and ears in places where others don't, an ability to move incognito, all of which others might want to make use of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I decide that every groups has a traits that's beneficial to its members ("All members of Team Batman ignore the first x points of firearms damage!"  "All members of the Police Special Detail have their own car"), then perhaps it should be the same as the trait I just mentioned.  That is, what makes a gang unique has to be something it can in some way trade, use as leverage or collateral.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote style="font-style: italic;"&gt;To summarize:  Gang behavior and persistence is a function of&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Inequality, and individual responses to reduce inequality,&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The ability of the gang (both leadership and rank and file) to manage the desires and behavior of people with defiant individualist characters,&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The degree to which a collective of individuals has been capable of developing a sophisticated organization to carry out its economic activities, and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The extent to which it has been able to establish ties to institutions belonging to the larger society.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So there you have it.  Mastering these four things means mastering the game, whatever form it eventually takes, if at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much, all you readers who stuck it out this far.  What do you think, too much at once?  I'm not 100% sure on the format.  Breaking each chapter up into sections that I can post once or twice a week might be much easier on both you and me.  If you have thoughts, please leave a comment!  Actually I'd love to hear people's opinions or ideas about any of:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The book&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The game&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This method of approaching them&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm nearly done with &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;War &amp; Peace&lt;/span&gt;, so it's my hope to finish the next chapter of &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Islands&lt;/span&gt; well before the end of June.

He remarked that he thought that indie-RPG people were so united in their despisal of D&amp;amp;D that he wouldn't have expected them to have a Gygaxian monster as a symbol.  Also, that numbering the second Camp Nerdly "01" was the nerdiest thing he'd heard of in a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All this prompted me to spare some time to write some impressions.  No real feedback or Actual Play type officiousness, I'm afraid, as I'm not really a very savvy player/observer yet, but there may be somethings others find of worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, tragedy: I took a lot of pictures at Nerdly, with the Woman's camera.  Unfortunately, soon after I got back, we broke up, and soon after that, she had to go home for the summer.  I will probably get the pictures eventually, since both of us are (or at least seem to be) without acrimony, but there you have it.  My dreams of even a mock-up Google Earth-enabled Nerdly photo album are temporarily dashed.  But so it goes!  I cut short this explanation due to the real danger of sounding sorry for myself, which I as of yet fail to be, and turning this into that most dreaded of things: a blog like any other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were seven games that I observed enough to have some kind of response to.  In chronological order:&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Jungle Speed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Watership Down&lt;/span&gt; via Shadow of Yesterday&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Open Boat&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Inuma&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;PTA&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thou Art But A Warrior&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seiyuu&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Jungle Speed&lt;/span&gt; is UNO meets War.  The cards have a variety of symbols and colors on them, some of which are devilishly similar to one another.  Everyone turns over a card from their stack.  Most of the time, everyone immediately turns over another, but if any two player's cards match in some way, whichever of them gets the little wooden chotchke in the middle of the table first gives all his dealt cards to the slower, everyone re-shuffles into stacks and starts over.  I've been looking more closely at games played with cards lately, since I've been insisting that Leviathan will be so played.  This one looked fun, though imposing for the slow-witted like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jason ran a game of &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Shadow of Yesterday&lt;/span&gt; where we all played rabbits.  The first thing that struck me was how beautifully crafted a set-up it was.  The characters were cranked up and aimed straight at each other.  The result varied between glory and confusion, but that's about the experience I have with any ensemble fiction; I've been reading &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;War and Peace&lt;/span&gt;, and either despite or because of each single character being portrayed vividly and in full, it gets plenty confusing as a whole.  I think that, just like in architecture, a group that is linked up properly can support its own weight much more than one that is linked haphazardly.  My instinctive response to gaming group size nowadays has been "no more than five players, period," and I have reasons for that, but I wonder whether, if there were more sophisticated systems for connecting characters to one another, the problems we seek to avoid by playing in small groups would be solved.  I'm hoping to see glimmers of this in &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Spirit of the Century&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing that struck me was how well the system matched the setting.  No doubt a lot of this was due to the work Jason put into making Keys and Secrets and such, but it still seemed like, at base, the system for Conan was the system for...I can't remember any of the characters from &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Watership Down&lt;/span&gt;.  It's been too long since I've read it.  Anyway, make no mistake: These were some extreme bunnies.  They took risks and names alike.  Stuff had to get done, and they did not shirk.  There were, however, at least two points where I was paralyzed by cuteness.  It was made all the more devastating by the fact that 90% of the time, these were people in a tough situation, arguing and fighting and manipulating...and then I called for an Instinct pool refresh, and Jason said maybe my character and his sister groomed each other for a little while.  I made very manly squealing noises.  I think in part because I could at times think of them as rabbits, I actually came to really, really &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;care&lt;/span&gt; about all these tough mothers, which never seems to happen when I play regular adventure-y games.  For me, this was not an amusing one-off idea ("Conan Bunnies!"), but an engaging and fascinating world that I want to create/explore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Idea: Game inspired by Looney Tunes, Kipling's Just So Stories, and simplified afro-cuban mythology, where everyone chooses a character from a fixed list of animals and tells the tale of "How [Main Character] [found/learned/gained/lost] [his/her/the] [quality/object]."  Or maybe, via Aesop, "The [Principal Characters Array(0)], the [Principal Characters Array(1)], ... and the [Principal Characters Array(N)]."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Open Boat is a game about Madness, Hunger and Despair.  Or, at least, that's what the character sheets say.  Back in the day, when I first understood the idea that the questions "What is your game about?" and "What are the names of the principle variables in your game?" should have the same answer, it gave me one of those moments of searing clarity that force re-evaluation of all that came before them.  It's a principle that is immensely near and dear to my heart, and that love might be the single factor which most endears me to the Indie RPG thing, and gives me the distaste for D&amp;amp;D that my friend expected from others in the community.  But then, there are games that I like that break this standard, so perhaps I'm not as enamored as I think.  The  worst offender is probably &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Artesia: Adventures in the Known World&lt;/span&gt;.  If I were to modify it, I would add a Quest Table or something, with the different levels of dedication you can have towards some goal, each giving you different bonuses towards accomplishing related tasks, penalties for unrelated ones, maybe bindings you get if you fail.  Then I'd add rules for how to gain and modify quests, and add a few references to my pretty table in the character-generation rules.  Of course, that all might be a bit out-of-genre.  The protagonists in the &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Artesia&lt;/span&gt; comics seem pretty blase about their goals...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LAME&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, Open Boat was unfinished, but well-crafted.  Jason (who made it) had edible tokens to represent food.  M&amp;amp;Ms served as Rations, but when they finally started butchering the dead for their succulent flesh, out came the beef jerky, cut into appropriate numbers of pieces!  It was alarming how hungry I got, watching this game.  Great fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find it a little difficult to explain and justify my excitement over &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Inuma&lt;/span&gt;.  Daniel once said of &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Burning Empires&lt;/span&gt; that the highest praise he could give it in our consumerist culture is that he was planning to pay 50 dollars to get it.  At a late stage in the game, Clinton said that he was planning to sell &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Inuma&lt;/span&gt; for more than that, and I was mildly upset I couldn't pay him for it right then and there.  I think that one of the reason that &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Burning Empires&lt;/span&gt; is such a dear part of my library and others is the shape and craft of it, the feel of completeness and...well, professionalism, I suppose.  I forget who originally said that it's less a book than an artifact.  Well, &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Inuma&lt;/span&gt;, in it's final stage, will be much, much more artifact than book.  It will be pretty beads and hand-painted blocks of wood and stitched-leather pamphlets in a padded box, hopefully one with "INUMA" enigmatically carved on the lid, Jumanji-style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Inuma&lt;/span&gt; is not a roleplaying game.  That is, there are (wonderful!) rules for collaboratively creating worlds, and then there are other rules for playing in those worlds.  However, the method of world creation gives you setting information such that you could very easily play that setting with any game system you wanted.  Further, you don't even have to play in it.  Clinton imagines writer's circles writing semi-overlapping  short stories, or other possibilities which I don't fully remember.  For any moment in time and group of people, there is a gate to fantastic unknown world lying in wait for YOU to discover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The How: The first part of setting creation, making the world itself, is a matter of making several lists.  Everyone at the table has to provide one entry for each list, but no more than two (I think).  If I remember rightly, the first list was Inspirations, the fiction or music or places that inspire the world, then general elements common to multiple inspirations, then specific elements present, somewhere, in the world, then thematic elements (Individual v. Society, etc).  Then, character cards are handed out.  There are three kinds of characters.  All characters have a [Name], a [Descriptor], and a [title, job, position].  Protagonists also have a [Thing they're responsible for], Antagonists have a [Selfish goal], and Anchors have a [Place that they live in].  First, everyone's given anchor cards.  You can fill in any &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;one&lt;/span&gt; of the traits on the card, then pass it to the next person around the table, who fills in another, etcetera until they're filled out.  Then everyone gets Antagonist cards, then another round of Anchors, then Protagonists.  The result of all this, as an observer, was one of the more vivid fantasy settings I have known.  I felt like I knew it in my bones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, willing to pay non-trivial money to get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: Once again, though I'm glossing over it, the system (which uses the beads and blocks) is actually quite rad.  I just couldn't formulate a more complex reaction than "Yay colors!" and it deserved either better or not at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I played a bang-up game of &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;PTA&lt;/span&gt; with Remi Treuer, Tony Lower-Basch, and Joshua A.C. Newman, all Famous Published people.  Also there were me and other normal people.  As it turned out, though, we were all secretly &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;PTA&lt;/span&gt; gods.  Those of us (not it!) who had played it before several times called it one of the best they had ever seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My character could beat up all their characters, but was in most all other respects inferior to them.  This and other things I noticed he had in common with essentially every other character I've ever made in roleplaying.  I wrote a list of these common traits, in the form of in-character statements, on the back of my character sheet, along with a sketch of a plot-significant locket.  Actually, I wish I had kept that piece of paper.  I spent all the ten minutes between the game ending and being asleep thinking about it.  I want to say (though I could be surprised) that everyone has some level of fixed, unchanging structure that all of their characters are lie atop, in play if not in creation.  It reminded me of the feeling I get when I play Bioware games: There may be many moral paths that the game supports, but there are some that I find it impossible to choose, and some that are clearly the "correct" ones, for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, it (the game, not my introspection) was an exhilarating experience.  A fair amount's already been said about this one elsewhere, mostly about how fantastic and not-suitable-for-all-ages it was, so I'm going to demur.  I will say that since the phase where we tried to figure out what fictional setting we were going to play in started with me saying "Barbarella!" seriously enough that I was expecting to be embarrassed by everyone's reactions, it was truly moving to see what resulted from everyone accepting that and building on it.  It was a fantastic story.  I would have bought at least the first season on DVD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone called out in the dining area, "Who wants to help playtest our adaptation of &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Polaris&lt;/span&gt; to the fall of the Spanish Islamic Republics?"  I nearly fell over getting out of my seat.  The other volunteer turned out to be Travis, who had been in my &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;PTA&lt;/span&gt; game, and who had sent me an email, I think a year ago,  to see if I wanted to play &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Polaris&lt;/span&gt;.  Small world!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was made a Mistaken, and the roles didn't really rotate, the author wanting to test other parts of the system.  It was a very strange experience to be in the position of an adversarial GM type guy for essentially the whole game.  I don't think I'm very good at it.  With all my shameful GM memories, it's my instinct to flee such 'heavy-handedness'.  Despite which, the game was rollicking tragic fun.  Travis was even more awesome than he had been in &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;PTA&lt;/span&gt;.  I'm really excited about the game itself, though.  It's a period I love, and the system adds an element of pacing that seems, from reading only, like it might be lacking in base &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Polaris&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last thing I did while I was there was watch a group play &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Seiyuu&lt;/span&gt;, an extensive hack for &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;PTA &lt;/span&gt;that adds a lot of things that, from playing one game only, seem to be absent.  Namely: A mechanic for designing a show, and one for saying "We've played this show enough, lets make a new one."  Plus, you all play japanese voice-actors, and the shows are all anime, and inherently non-lame anime at that.   Basically, it's a bit like &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Inuma&lt;/span&gt;; There are lists of plot elements, stylistic animation elements, etc.  Everyone makes one suggestion for each list, then everyone ranks the suggestions one to five, and the highest scoring three (I think) become part of the show.  I found that completely fascinating.  To return once again to &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Burning Empires&lt;/span&gt; as an example, I think that collaborative setting creation &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;with mechanical underpinnings&lt;/span&gt; is one of the great uncharted territories in roleplaying right now.  I'm worried that this will make me want to include it in Leviathan 'just because'.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several non-game things I wanted to chronicle:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The weather&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Globe and Laurel&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Improv Workshops&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;There was a stretch of road between the base and the highway that, every time I drove down it, the sky was so beautiful that I had to take pictures continuously.  My father once said, with a snort of derision, mostly to himself, though I was there, walking along the shore of Biscane Bay as the setting sun behind us lit the water pinkish-bluish-grey, "Imagine, having tender feelings for the &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Atlantic&lt;/span&gt;!"  So, I felt that, but for Virginia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came to the park on Friday with the erroneous assumption that Dinner that day was one of the meals the camp was providing.  Several people mentioned places they had gotten food from.  Chinese places, McDonalds.  While I was aimlessly driving around Triangle, I happened upon one of the more astounding establishments I've ever frequented.  The &lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;q=globe+and+laurel,+triangle+va&amp;amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;amp;sspn=47.167389,82.265625&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;view=text&amp;amp;latlng=38536190,-77345760,13949728482670822766&amp;amp;ei=L_JNRsXONIvarQLO9OTiBw&amp;amp;sig2=6LGUP9yw9c7piwOCiUHplA&amp;amp;cd=1"&gt;Globe and Laurel&lt;/a&gt; is clearly run by and for retired officers.  Not only was it full of them, but the staff is dressed in livery, and calmly addresses everyone "Sir" (I don't think I saw any female customers), and even serve crusty, brown military bread.  At one point, one man at the larger table joking suggested that someone once asked an absent friend "[Name], what is best in life?"  And god-damn if &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;the entire restaurant didn't finish that quote!&lt;/span&gt;  "To crush your enemies, see them driven before you, and to hear the lamentations of their women!"  Raucous laughter.  Cries of "love that film" and "woo!  Arnie!"  I distinctly remember thinking: "This is a good omen for the weekend."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All meals come with soup and salad, and the french onion soup was, if not to die, at least to kill for.  The rest of the food was also fantastic (except for the bread, which was, as I implied, more notable for its nostalgic qualities), they had a great selection of longnecks (though the local brew I chose to sample was a bit weak), and the decor!  It is not hyperbole to suggest that every inch of space was covered with memorabilia; Medals, newspaper clippings, photos, campaign ribbons...my table was lucite covering a museum-quality display of an airman who was a famous cartoonist during World War 2 and the Korean conflict.  You couldn't get away from it, but for me at least, it still managed to be civil to the eye, so to speak.  Not garish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The point being: If there is another Nerdly in my future, I must go to this place again.  Hopefully not alone, this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, Remi and Jason favored us with improv workshops.  I see now that at least some of their being astounding human beings is due to their attending the real thing.  This was probably, no insult to anyone else, the most entertaining portion of my weekend.  It was also the most challenging and frustratingly difficult.  These two factors combine to make me really, really want to do it more.  I feel as if it would help more than 'my game';  My confidence is not the greatest, and I think it could do with the tiniest boosting.  Between improv and public speaking, I know which would be a more fun form of self-help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Example: As people gathered at the end of the weekend to hang out, I got antsy.  I left camp without saying goodbye to any of the fantastic people I had met, without telling them that they were fantastic.  I drove back home, getting (again!) lost in the DC mess.  Nerdly was on the same weekend as Reality, St. Johns' annual violent and debauched mega-party.  (Aside I can't help but want to share: The Wikipedia talk page for St. Johns contains an extensive debate over the likely existence of Reality)  I arrived on campus just as people were scattering from the recently-ended Spartan Madball game.  I had gone from one group-that-seemed-to-know-eachother-and-not-me to another.  Also, I might have been dehydrated.  I was irritable, mistrustful of people's efforts to include me.  I doubted their sincerity when they expressed friendship.  They're nice people, I thought, that's their instinctive response, that's what they want to say and think about everyone.  No bitterness towards them, but I know there's no genuine basis for their friendship because, experience tells me, I'm not a readily likeable person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other reason I got started writing this post was that also yesterday (now a very vague term), I got an email from Jason saying that he and Remi had been talking about me, and how they wanted to see me around the discussions and forums more.  'Become our internet friend' is how Jason, ever-equipped with quips, put it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was only a little stunned, just like I'm only a little choked up now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm friend to, by my lifetime averages, a lot of people, but it's not work to have lots of friends; I'm friends with all of them, because with I find it easy to be.  It's easy to be around them and listen to what they have to say and be alternately saddened and joy-ed when they are, and to express myself openly and honestly to them.  The internet, forums especially, at times feels like a combination of an empty room and an immense succession of parties, groups which you start out as an outsider to (I think that's why I have taken to blogging; I don't have to worry about anyone reading it, except for myself and potential employers googling my name).  I (can't you tell?) have never been up on parties much, but friends are something that I can get firmly behind.  I know that I can be a friend, and I'm extremely proud of it.  Jason's reminded me that we're all here to help one another, even on the Internet, and I know I can be his friend, and I'm proud of that too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also Remi, Travis, and all the other people who I met whose names, due to limits of my own faculties, I have no real chance of remembering.  I didn't see any spoilers at Nerdly harshing the vibe.  You're all good folk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I think improv would help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Nick</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/2652752792945031197'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/2652752792945031197'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2007/05/camp-nerdly-report.html' title='Camp Nerdly Report'/><author><name>Nick Novitski</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08863651199447917923</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31707300.post-6037892293903830877</id><published>2007-04-18T15:50:00.001-04:00</published><updated>2009-06-01T22:24:20.268-04:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ethics'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='then I had some toast'/><title type='text'>Birthday</title><content type='html'>Today, I complete my 25th year.  People (in my experience) often say, of useless things, "That and a quarter will buy you a cup of coffee."  Now, I have a quarter.  Does this obviate my uselessness?  Zhuang Zhe would probably comment that the qualities which make things 'useful' are rarely of benefit to them, and that such judgments are fraught with received and often incorrect opinion in any case.  Casting my innumerable regrets aside for one short moment, let me say that:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The beginning of my life is set and completed&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It was quite nice, judging by the effects it had on me, compared to many less fortunate&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;My belief in people (i.e., their actions) as functions of their environments/upbringings, dictates my reactions to them.  When interacting with someone who I see as partly responsible for 'how I turned out,' I remember just how much I am indebted and grateful to them; With all people in general, I try to act in such a way as they will have reason to be grateful to me, or (more likely) at least to have no reason to begrudge me.  The more deterministic we recognize human behavior to be, the more sensitive we should become in our dealings with others.  In this way, I can say that patent disbelief in the immortal soul and other nonsense has led me to ethical behaviors or, if you prefer, ethical nature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This might seem rather grandiose for a "Happy Birthday to me" post, but it was on my mind, and I have tried to make this blog an outlet only for what I would not be averse to everyone I ever meet having read.

One is code-named Leviathan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The setting hasn't changed much since I first conceived it.  A Space Station managed (not ruled, precisely) by an artificial intelligence committed to demonstrating the consistency and correctness of a certain social philosophy.  The end result being a cross between the urban underbelly chronicled in noir fiction and an enlightened technological utopia.  So to speak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The system has changed rapidly as I imagine different focuses for the game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Originally, I imagined it as for the computer, a cross between a Sim City and System Shock.  You would name a character, select from one of several backgrounds ("Betrayed and left for dead," "youngest son of da boss," etc.) which would effect your starting situation and abilities, then be let loose to do what you wanted.  The focus would be on the interplay between the different factions and forces in the setting with each other, especially as it is effected by the player.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, I thought I might use the &lt;a href="http://www.sorcerer-rpg.com/"&gt;Sorcerer&lt;/a&gt; pen-and-paper roleplaying system.   Hard-bitten men and women left for dead, failed hustlers and movers, who Leviathan suffused with his own nanotechnology to create deniable assets to prosecute missions that defend the system against the excesses that it allows, so that no one figures out that the system is a failure.  The focus would be on the inhumanity demanded of citizens of the perfect urban society.  This is the phase where I came up with  a possible subtitle for the game that stuck with me: "Sci-fi Crime Fiction in the City of the Philosophers' Nightmares."  Not at all pretentious, of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most recently, I had a card-revelation.   Each player has a deck of variable size, with each card being a character (or property, or maybe some other things), consisting of one or two numbers, one or two abilities, and several links to other cards in your deck.  The focus would be on the interplay between factions I mentioned before, and their creation via their 'population.'  It occured to me that in this alien, yet all too familiar society, the term 'gang' might have lost its pejorative connotations, and become merely a term for associations of people working for a common goal in close fellowship; Basically the same things that are called 'Adventuring Parties' in Dungeons and Dragons, except in a modern urban setting, and born from the semi-shared motivations of its participants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this is where I am now: looking for rules that govern different players creating and managing their gangs in conflict with one another, using cards.  For this to work at all, I needed an idea for the mechanic of gang organization.  So I did what anyone would (should) do: I searched for 'gang' on &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/"&gt;google book search&lt;/a&gt;, and found &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0520074343&amp;id=OkjBw39Q1kYC&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;pg=PP1&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;amp;ots=j6IH-g6D6u&amp;dq=islands+in+the+street%5C&amp;amp;sig=8l4jKXYxwzqAe4hk5sgK_LSfD9E"&gt;Islands in the Street: Gangs and Urban American Society&lt;/a&gt;, by Martin Sanchez Jankowski.  Reading the preview that book search provides, how did I find the first chapter to open?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;To this war of everyman, against everyman, this is also consequent; that nothing can be unjust.  The notions of right and wrong, justice and injustice have there no place.  Where there is no common power, there is no law: where no law, no injustice.  force, and fraud, are in war the two cardinal virtues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;With a quote from Thomas Hobbes' &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Leviathan&lt;/span&gt;, of course!  So that was auspicious.  It looked like exactly what I was looking for.  After I clicked the 'find in libraries near me' button, and saw that a copy was at the Naval Academy library, it seemed to all be coming together.  Having had a friend check it out, I will now be engaging to read it, posting notes on the blog using the newly commissioned 'leviathan' tag.  The first post should come (relatively) soon, as I have pretty much finished the first chapter, and it will better explain just how suited the book seems to my task.  I don't expect to have anything ready to playtest at &lt;a href="http://campnerdly.org"&gt;Camp Nerdly&lt;/a&gt; or anything, but I hope to have some mechanics and cards to mess around with by the time school starts again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Nick</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2007/04/islands-in-street-introduction.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/5094584304027085103'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/5094584304027085103'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2007/04/islands-in-street-introduction.html' title='Islands in the Street: Introduction'/><author><name>Nick Novitski</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08863651199447917923</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31707300.post-3974491964191235501</id><published>2007-03-07T17:15:00.002-05:00</published><updated>2008-10-29T13:58:12.767-04:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='journalism'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='stupid'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='health'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='history'/><title type='text'>To Our Health</title><content type='html'>My father has played many roles in his life, but those who know him best will probably always think of him as a journalist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He is, very unlike me, exceedingly loyal, honoring the institutions that happened to pass through above others in their field.  &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;His&lt;/span&gt; college, Yale.  &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;His &lt;/span&gt;armed service branch, the Navy.  &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;His&lt;/span&gt; paper, the Times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've been raised to idealize it, so I'm always distressed when it publishes &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/07/business/07soda.html?ex=1331010000&amp;amp;en=2fd77b42c89c43c1&amp;amp;ei=5124&amp;amp;partner=permalink&amp;amp;exprod=permalink"&gt;an article that misses obvious points&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, after first trying to discourage restaurants that use their syrup from serving tap water (unsuccessfully), and then trying to convince people that being in a plastic bottle makes tap water magically healthy (very successfully), Coca Cola corporation (and Pepsi and all the more intelligent competition) is now planning to market a new line of soft drinks fortified with essential vitamins and minerals.  In Coca Cola's case, they will be called "Plus," as in "Diet Coke Plus!" and "Sprite Plus!"  Which is so laughably and clearly ridiculous, the writer of the article tip-toes around calling them out for their short-sighted, arrogant, grasping greed.  Instead, he  paints a self-congratulatory picture of recent consumer awareness, that has made even those products that are the definition of unhealthy (Coke being associated with diabetes, obesity, addiction, osteoporosis, rotted teeth and engine degreasing) revise their recipes for our health's sake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, the writer is surprisingly unfamiliar with the origins of Coke for an educated person, much less a person whose job it is to be informed, in this case, about Coke.  Jake Pemberton was a patent medicine seller.  'Patent medicines' are what we jaded moderns would call snake oil, elixirs whose only virtue was their ability to project an image that capitalized on a health fad (more on which in a moment) and, credit where it's due, pemberton's patent medicine, a dark concoction of coca leaves, kola nuts, sugar and voodoo magic, was a great one.  "A valuable brain-tonic," his ad copy crowed, "and cure for all nervous afflictions!"  So indeed, sodas find their origin as a health drink, and Coca Cola marketed their drink as a headache(and other things)-cure for as long as they put cocaine in it.  Several sources misreport that as ending in 1902, when it was first reduced, only phased out entirely in the early 30s, and you better believe that every time one addictive ingredient was reduced in quantity, the other (kola nuts, or rather, by that time, their active ingredient, caffeine) was increased.  So, if the writer had checked his history even slightly, he would have seen that the business of soft drink makers has long been to make something unhealthy for us to toast our health with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, the image of our era as being uniquely health-focused is even more history-blind.  There have been at least two other such eras in the last century, though neither matched the mania of the last quarter of the 19th century.  Several stores in miami used to have wallpaper made from newspaper advertisements of the time, thick with promises of energy, clarity, attractiveness (none of which sounds familiar at all to anyone who watches television or listens to radio or looks at billboards, I'm sure).  Why were the Wright brothers able to finance inventing aeronautical engineering from a bicycle repair shop?  Because bicycles were immensely popular among the middle class, not for practical reasons (horses were relatively cheap in America), but for perceived health benefits.  The cheapest way to envision this era is to take a look around and mentally replace surgical and chemical cures with electric and herbal ones.  The less cheap way is to watch &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Road to Wellville,&lt;/span&gt; a movie I once used to win the Kevin Bacon Game when the target was Dana Carvey (the other player tried to go &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Wayne's World&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Austin Powers 3&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Man Who Would be King&lt;/span&gt;...the fool!).  The insanity of 'retreats' and 'rest cures' is captured, if not entertainingly, at least...existingly?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personal Anecdote:  The health craze effected change beyond America, and beyond patent medicines.  Around the same time, the St. James Brewery was using it's 'Guinness for health' campaign, whose effects persist in Ireland to this day. "Two pints of Guinness, a pound of steak and a fried egg every day," an affable bar-encrustation proudly vouchsafed to Hiro and I, "and they'll never be able to find anything wrong with you as long as you live."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway!  Sodas being bad for you isn't news either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the New Chivalry - Health, published 1915&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"My experience with coca cola shows that continued users of it are severely impaired in their digestion...In my opinion the consumption of coca cola, assuming that it contains the ingredients as shown by Mr. Fuller's analysis, would seriously affect the health of a normal individual..."&lt;/blockquote&gt;From the New Dietetics (everything was new back then), published 1921&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Dr. Wiley has shown that coca drinks contain practically as much caffein as does the same amount of coffee .  They are simply flavored decoctions of caffein.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"There are mischiefs in the soda fountain preparations which renders them even more dangerous than coffee.  These are first, the fact that they are always ready and accessible at any hour of the day and night.  Second, that they are generally supposed to be not only innocent of possible harmful effects, but through most alluring advertising are presented to the public as possessing most remarkable benificent properties.  As a result, not only adults, but children are induced to use caffein in the form of a soda fountain beverage, and in large quantities who would never use coffee in the same manner.  In other words, the public are beguiled.  Cola drinks are an insidious poison, the sale of which should be prohibited by law."&lt;/blockquote&gt;Kudos to Google Book Search, who makes it easy to research things, even if you're not a professional journalist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I'll end this odd entry with something from the &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;New &lt;/span&gt;(!)&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt; Atlantis&lt;/span&gt;, so I can feel like I did some essay work today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"We have drinks also brewed with several herbs, and roots, and spices; yea with several fleshes and white meats; whereof some of the drinks are such, as they are in effect meat and drink both: so that divers, especially in age, do desire to live with them, with little or no meat or bread.  And above all, we strive to have drinks of extreme thin parts, to insinuate into the body, and yet without all biting, sharpness, or fretting; insomuch as some of them put upon the back of your hand will, with a little stay, pass through to the palm, and yet taste mild to the mouth.  We have also waters which we ripen in that fashion, as they become nourishing; so that they are indeed excellent drink; and many will use no other."&lt;/blockquote&gt;He invented &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;everything&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Nick</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2007/03/to-our-health.html#comment-form' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/3974491964191235501'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/3974491964191235501'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2007/03/to-our-health.html' title='To Our Health'/><author><name>Nick Novitski</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08863651199447917923</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31707300.post-6475179247138506751</id><published>2007-03-04T22:10:00.001-05:00</published><updated>2008-08-19T20:58:57.418-04:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ethics'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='school'/><title type='text'>Annual Essay thoughts</title><content type='html'>After great pains, I reached a decision on a topic just before &lt;s&gt;spring break&lt;/s&gt;essay writing period.  Francis Bacon's &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;New Atlantis&lt;/span&gt; is (or contains) an allegory for some kind of society of natural philosophers.  I want to use any and all reputable sources (the &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Atlantis&lt;/span&gt; itself, plus the &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Advancement of Learning&lt;/span&gt; and a bunch of essays) to expand on the idea of a Baconian college as much as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mr. Schulman, typically, turned out to be exceedingly familiar with yet another program author I'm very fond of.  He was down with the idea.  It's a mixed blessing, of course, because he will immediately know if I&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;try to bullshit, or&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;am earnest but incorrect in my interpretation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;To this I say, no problem!   My task is one of extrapolation, and it's simplified by having a clear theory of what I'm extrapolating.  Richard Dawkins says that Theology is a non-subject (and don't get shirty with him, cultural anthropology, sociology, psychology, those are all subjects that have something real, namely religion, as their object).   Bacon, if he had the position explained well to him, would probably agree.   But then he'd say exactly the same thing about literary criticism, and nearly every other subject in the liberal arts.   To Bacon, the value of a story, true or false, is found in what practical lessons it can teach the reader, and &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;that's it&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Think about your favorite Shakespeare play (if you even have one, you uncultured boob).  Now, tell me what it teaches the reader to think and do.  Now, if you manage to come up with an unambiguous answer, tell me how practical that lesson is, that is, how it enhances the (almost certainly material) good of mankind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find it hard.  Which means that the inevitable question (even if treated implicitly), of what this program author would think of the program, will require a conflicted and tortured answer.  Don't you hate when figures you idolize for their focused ideology are found disagree with you on some other point you find important?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Nick</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2007/03/annual-essay-thoughts.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/6475179247138506751'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/6475179247138506751'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2007/03/annual-essay-thoughts.html' title='Annual Essay thoughts'/><author><name>Nick Novitski</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08863651199447917923</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31707300.post-5081180067709359015</id><published>2007-02-26T11:27:00.002-05:00</published><updated>2008-08-19T20:58:05.757-04:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ethics'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='school'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='religion'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='writing'/><title type='text'>Les Maux Triomphant</title><content type='html'>[Here's my last language paper.  It was pointed out to me recently that I (and the four other students who share every class with me) only had four essays assigned in the first semester, compared to the average of six.  Unfortunately, I would not venture to say that quality won out over quantity in my case.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: lucida grande; font-style: italic;"&gt;La philosophie triomphe aisément des maux passés et des maux à venir.  Mais les maux présents triomphent d'elle. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: lucida grande;"&gt;[Philosophy easily defeats past ills and ills to come.  But present ills defeat Philosophy.]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: lucida grande;"&gt;-Maxime 22, Rochefoucauld&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: lucida grande;"&gt;Near the end of Plutarch's life of Cato, with the Rome he fought for lost and his death approaching, the statesman finds solace in "Plato's dialogue on the soul."  In &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: lucida grande; font-style: italic;"&gt;De Rerum Natura&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: lucida grande;"&gt;, Lucretius finds solace in the Epicurean claims that fears of death and the supernatural come from misperceptions of how things truly are.  But whether stoic or sensualist, for all they might firm us against future tragedies or let us come to terms with past ones, all philosophies fail in the face of the tragedy itself, as it happens.  Perhaps there are no atheists in foxholes, but neither do even the most devout find comfort in foxhole prayer, in the extreme of pain and fear.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: lucida grande;"&gt;And these philosophies which overcome our misfortunes certainly include prayers, or rather, religions, as well.  The sentiment is almost identical to Lucretius's anecdote about the priest of a particular temple of Poseidon showing a skeptical visitor about.  The priest indicates a wall covered with the inscriptions and buried beneath the donatives of sailors who had prayed to be saved in the midst of perilous storms and escaped unscathed.  Wasn't this a stirring demonstration of the power of both the god and his temple.  "Maybe," the visitor responds hesitantly, "but where are all the donations from the sailors who weren't saved?"  Misfortune leads us to cry out to the gods of our culture, but our prayers are defeated by the present ill.  Pain is more real than any god, and tragedy is never accounted for by any system of belief, except either before or after the fact.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: lucida grande;"&gt;I say "belief" only to include religious faith in the reduction, not to ignore that it is "philosophy" that is being reduced.  It is not that some gullible people are guided by untested faith in invisible saviors, while those who bother to examine themselves are Philosophers, entirely different creatures, safe in their icy castles of reason, immune to these delusions of comfort.  All&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: lucida grande; font-weight: bold;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: lucida grande;"&gt;philosophies, including but not limited to super-naturalist faiths, are alike in that they can only comfort inasmuch as they can account for ills in a way that is comforting.  The actual action of philosophy is this accounting, while comfort is the result.  So if philosophy fails in the face of present ills, it fails to account for them.  But if any philosophy ever fails at all, it is in its action, in failing to account for something.  And if philosophy fails in action, that is certainly an ill, so to face the ills of the present moment is to fail by definition.  But it is not the ill that defeats philosophy, for those past and those yet to come are defeated.  No, it is that the hardship is present, that it is actually happening even now.  The present, the section of time most verifiably real, is antithetical to philosophy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: lucida grande;"&gt;Only the past and future can be systematized into an understandable account.  The past, since it is narrated to us by memory and tastes.  Freed from the dross of the events which gave us the memory, dry and safe ideas can be sorted by our reason and beliefs, and unrestrained by the linearity of material causes, those ideas and their sortings change as quickly as our preference of how to remember it does.  The past is mutable, and the future is even worse!  An exercise in imagination, which can also be called desire, it changes even faster, yet still seems to be the same: Exactly as we would have it. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: lucida grande;"&gt;If we call present and material things real, then the past and future are made phantoms and mental illusions.  And Philosophy, which is both reason and belief, having only these phantoms as its possible objects, can be nothing but a gloss on the unreal.  Conversely, the world that we inhabit and experience can never be directly grasped by any systemic understanding.  Thoughts do not "exist" as real things do.  People think, to be sure, but thinking does not produce a thing.  For example, if I have a toy that, with appropriate prodding, can look like either an tow-truck or a humanoid robot, no matter how much I play with it, I will never have truly made anything.  I will have changed the appearance of a single object between some number of states, but those states are not objects in themselves; They do not exist separate from that real object they are predicated of, being only attributes of the object.  Likewise, a particular state of the mind does not constitute a separate thing, no matter how we call it "a thought."  But we can think of such things as separate, just as we can mentally separate the motion of a pendulum from the pendulum itself.  If we say that the present and actual things have a nature called "reality," then thoughts must have a nature differing from this.  What is this nature?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: lucida grande;"&gt;The efficient causes of actual events are also sufficient; whatever exists in a given present results only from the state of the present just past, and causes nothing else but the state of the present to follow.  A given state can only have one cause and one effect.  But after one person perceives the event, if they report it to someone else, then its causes change radically.  Stories are formed in reaction to events or thoughts (which are themselves in reaction to events), and are are of differing nature from the actual.  The present exists as an actuality, but the past and future exist as stories, networks of unreal causes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: lucida grande;"&gt;If a country falls to an invading army, it "means" nothing but that it happened, and happened simply, without grand and overarching purposes.  The conquering general might have plans and hopes for the territory he will gain, but this intent is not the cause of his victory.  For that, we must give credit to the circumstances of money and men and weather and luck that preceded his victorious moment.  And those circumstances can be traced to their equally meaningless efficient causes, and so on and so forth, event after event, present after present, as far back as reason investigates.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: lucida grande;"&gt;But if this were to happen in a story, the cause is in the intent of the author to communicate something in addition to the mere 'fact' of the event.  If the story is fictional, this intent might be, in the short term, to encourage engrossment in the excitement of violent uncertainty, and in the long term, to elicit sympathy in us for the conquered.  If the story is historical, the intent might be to explain how a certain era ended with the political and economic dominance of the conquering country, or the sweeping effects of some recent innovation in military technology, or simply to instill nationalist pride (or xenophobic fear) in the readership.  For these intents and any others, there is a meaning to the event, a purpose above any desire of the participants or requirement of the physical laws which might govern them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: lucida grande;"&gt;This authorial intent does not (usually) arise from a dry, icy desire to manipulate the reader.  The meaning he wishes to communicate is often, especially in non-fictional works, what meaning the events truly have in his perceptions.  He does not merely believe there is a connection between the invasion and the dominance of the victor or the weapon, he &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: lucida grande; text-decoration: underline;"&gt;sees&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: lucida grande;"&gt; it, as surely as he sees his hands before his face.  We are all both the readers and the authors of our past and future.  Our memories and desires are written, edited and rewritten by nothing but ourselves.  We force meaning upon the past and future, making stories from mere events, without even noticing ourselves doing it, so servile are our memories and desires.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: lucida grande;"&gt;This Philosophy is inseparable from our very sentience;  As long as we we are aware of both ourselves and other things, then we will try to see connections between the two.  And if this philosophy is, in some sense, what we speak of when we say "I," then it is our very selves that are lost in the face of ills.  It is our identity that is an illusion provided after the fact.  The soul is a story that a liar tells to himself, and philosophy can only exist by forcing itself not to know the truth of its non-existence.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people might find this depressing.  Heck, some reports indicate that Rochefoucauld might have used his philosophy as an excuse for the most grating kind of self-important misanthropy.  I can understand why, but I don't agree.  For some reason, no misanthropy or nihilism, no matter their emo-tastic bleakness, can depress me.  I occasionally get antsy with self-loathing, sure, but thats an undramatic and familiar kind of depression.  The eventual annihilation I can expect from my life annoys me profoundly, but doesn't get me in the doldrums like believing that I haven't been the employee/child/friend my boss/parents/friends deserve.</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2007/02/la-philosophie-triomphe-aisment-des.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/5081180067709359015'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/5081180067709359015'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2007/02/la-philosophie-triomphe-aisment-des.html' title='Les Maux Triomphant'/><author><name>Nick Novitski</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08863651199447917923</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31707300.post-4858781384541412065</id><published>2007-01-14T13:55:00.001-05:00</published><updated>2009-03-02T22:24:50.610-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='actual play'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='gaming'/><title type='text'>Drowning and Falling</title><content type='html'>One of my new year's resolutions that I expect to keep was to post write-ups of the two games that I played last fall that I never talked about here.  Inspired by &lt;a href="http://www.somethingawful.com/articles.php?a=4394"&gt;Steve's Character Guide&lt;/a&gt;, I'll do&lt;a href="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/games/index.php?game=drowning_and_falling"&gt; Drowning and Falling&lt;/a&gt; first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/games/index.php?game=drowning_and_falling"&gt;Drowning and Falling&lt;/a&gt; is kinda like &lt;a href="http://www.sjgames.com/munchkin/game/"&gt;Munchkin&lt;/a&gt;; the various tropes of 'classic' fantasy rpgs are amped to 11, and you die a lot.  Here's the tale of our doughty adventuring band:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the way to the dungeon, it began to rain.  As we walked down the muddy, potholed road, a pack of jeering children began hurling rocks at us.  Not three feet into the dungeon, a narrow strip of the 10'x10' corridor dropped about six inches, tripping us and barking us on the knee.  At the end of a rollicking minecart ride, we were ejected toward a target painted on a suspiciously stained rock wall.  We woke up in an orc tribe's village, where they made us partake in their manhood ritual; We had to run over a series of rolling logs  suspended  above a pond of discusting orc water.  After escaping, we encountered evidence of Intelligent But Tired Design, when a bridgekeeper tried to keep us from crossing a bridge over...the ground.  Tired from our travails, we rested the night in a spooky mansion on a dark hilltop, and were amazed when the entire building started spinning us like bingo balls!  We traveled through the bog of eternal stench (of &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Labyrinth &lt;/span&gt;fame) and were attacked by a stinky minotaur.  Finally reaching the dungeon again, the doorbell at the side entrance caused the gargoyles overhead to vomit a torrent of boiling pitch at us.  Hacking our way past this obstacle, we came to a broad canyon with a cannon on our side and a depressingly thin twin mattress on the other.  Finally, at the heart of the dungeon, we found a simple barrel of water with some apples bobbing on the surface...WHICH TURNED OUT TO BE A LEVEL 30 APPLE BOBBING BARREL MIMIC!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a long slog and a tough battle.  We lost a lot of good men, but in the end, with such awesome challenges, monsters, and of course, a huge pile of treasure, everyone was a winner.  Two thumbs way up.</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2006/10/drowning-and-falling.html#comment-form' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/4858781384541412065'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/4858781384541412065'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2006/10/drowning-and-falling.html' title='Drowning and Falling'/><author><name>Nick Novitski</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08863651199447917923</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31707300.post-3848493825416645239</id><published>2007-01-04T12:53:00.001-05:00</published><updated>2008-08-19T12:24:20.447-04:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='fiction'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='reading'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='writing'/><title type='text'>Winterval Reading</title><content type='html'>I'm more of a reader than a writer.  So I tried to use the former to jostle myself into the latter.  Here are the books which I read this break, in the order which they were completed, with remarks written in a style appropriate to the work considered:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 130%;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FMiddlemarch-Penguin-Classics-George-Eliot%2Fdp%2F0141439548%2Fsr%3D8-1%2Fqid%3D1167936529%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks&amp;amp;tag=thatbriginst-20&amp;amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325"&gt;Middlemarch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=thatbriginst-20&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;l=ur2&amp;amp;o=1" style="border: medium none ! important; margin: 0px ! important;" width="1" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;by George Eliot&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 0in;"&gt;Before reading the editor's preface (which act is frowned upon in polite St. John's society), I do not recall knowing that 'George Eliot' was a pseudonym for a female author. However, if I had not read said preface, I am quite confident that I would have readily inferred said gender from the fact that the book was just that good. Which is not to imply that readers of "Eliot's" time were stolid, unaware, or in any way not up to the task of reading &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FMiddlemarch-Penguin-Classics-George-Eliot%2Fdp%2F0141439548%2Fsr%3D8-1%2Fqid%3D1167936529%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks&amp;amp;tag=thatbriginst-20&amp;amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325"&gt;Middlemarch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=thatbriginst-20&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;l=ur2&amp;amp;o=1" style="border: medium none ! important; margin: 0px ! important;" width="1" /&gt; (which task is not insignificant, many will insist to you) relative to me.  No, my only gift is the clarity that distance from a previous time can lend one.  Works less-regarded in the social context they examine can rise to bob on the shoulders of their more famous contemporaries as the ages turn, the way rocks of various sizes shook in a jar sort into strata like obedient schoolchildren.  &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FMiddlemarch-Penguin-Classics-George-Eliot%2Fdp%2F0141439548%2Fsr%3D8-1%2Fqid%3D1167936529%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks&amp;amp;tag=thatbriginst-20&amp;amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325"&gt;Middlemarch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=thatbriginst-20&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;l=ur2&amp;amp;o=1" style="border: medium none ! important; margin: 0px ! important;" width="1" /&gt; is one of those works, that captures in amber for perpetuity both a specific society and universal human folly.

Georges is a man not many have heard of, which is how he wants it.  And why should we?  His only claim to fame was being the first to realize what Bugsy Siegel was really building in the Nevada desert.  It's amazing that more people didn't notice with him.  Maybe holding the Flamingo Hotel's grand opening on Christmas, temporarily closing it on a friday soon after, then having a glorious re-opening on Easter was too obscure for the average guy.  There may have been a few others who knew, though.  It's not like Siegel hid it.  That tan, and all that time spent working out, seeking physical perfection.  The way dogs used to howl and the moon hung low and protective whenever Virginia Hill (hell, even the name!) walked into the room.  But this is all a waste of space, because Georges is not the hero of the book.  That honor goes to Mr. Powers, who doesn't just throw Arthurian/Frazerian/American myth into a blender, he stirs and shakes them expertly in a mixer, making a drink with a powerful kick and a smooth finish, plants it in front of you at the bar and says with a grin, "Stephen King, eat your blind fucking heart out."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 130%;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAnansi-Boys-Neil-Gaiman%2Fdp%2F0060515198%2Fsr%3D1-2%2Fqid%3D1168102380%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks&amp;amp;tag=thatbriginst-20&amp;amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325"&gt;Anansi Boys&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=thatbriginst-20&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;l=ur2&amp;amp;o=1" style="border: medium none ! important; margin: 0px ! important;" width="1" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;by Neil Gaiman&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many people seem to have an unnatural love for Mr. Gaiman, and I am not one of them.  But his book about Anansi's two sons charmed me easily.  It is entertaining and therefore short, but merits more full consideration.  It explains things plainly without saying them explicitly.  It is fantastical without being too precious, and funny without being (too) British.  It is a story about storytelling, inspired by tribal myths and American funny animal cartoons.  &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLast-Call-Tim-Powers%2Fdp%2F038072846X%2Fsr%3D1-1%2Fqid%3D1168102726%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks&amp;amp;tag=thatbriginst-20&amp;amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325"&gt;Last Call&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=thatbriginst-20&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;l=ur2&amp;amp;o=1" style="border: medium none ! important; margin: 0px ! important;" width="1" /&gt; creates a world of desperate people who figured out a way to assume archetypal roles and gain immense power, who have been fighting over it ever since.  &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAnansi-Boys-Neil-Gaiman%2Fdp%2F0060515198%2Fsr%3D1-2%2Fqid%3D1168102380%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks&amp;amp;tag=thatbriginst-20&amp;amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325"&gt;Anansi Boys&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=thatbriginst-20&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;l=ur2&amp;amp;o=1" style="border: medium none ! important; margin: 0px ! important;" width="1" /&gt; spins a tale about a man who is sometimes a spider, and how his being a lazy wise-ass saved the world.

If so, I hope that you will still be willing to read and consider this book, and my review of it, for the simple reason that the authors of both are interested in finding the evidence that demonstrates the advantages of your specific religious practices, advantages up to and including the truth of them.  Richard Dawkins wants people to stop forcing themselves to take religion seriously, but Daniel Dennet wants people to stop forcing themselves to remain ignorant to religion.  Laid out in this book is a plain and honest argument for allowing the careful study of the natural phenomena of religion: It's effects and causes.  Everyone, if they feel either an obligation to believe true things or a belief that they already do, should read this book quickly, so we can all agree to find out all the things we don't know yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 130%;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FValis-Philip-K-Dick%2Fdp%2F0679734465%2Fsr%3D8-1%2Fqid%3D1168101842%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks&amp;amp;tag=thatbriginst-20&amp;amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325"&gt;V.A.L.I.S.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=thatbriginst-20&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;l=ur2&amp;amp;o=1" style="border: medium none ! important; margin: 0px ! important;" width="1" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;by Philip K. Dick&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Victory Newman read this book and found herself unable to think about religion in the way she used to call rational.  She told me that she thought she knew now what we had always been so afraid of, what it was like to go crazy.  I was understandably worried about her.  I was worried that she might begin doubting reality, hallucinating elaborate theistic conspiracies, and attempting suicide, just like Philip K. Dick, the main character had, in this novel by Philip K. Dick.  I was especially worried about the suicide part.  Philip K. Dick was a talented writer, and even he committed suicide eventually, I think I heard, and I guess I have an unnatural respect for writers.  I equated his ability to string words together coherently with being able to do the same with thoughts.  But Victory isn't stupid.  Intelligence doesn't save you from insanity, it just makes your insanity complicated.  To your eyes, anyway.  There's a simple emotional reason, an unhealing wound, like the Fisher King, except you can't see it, so instead of being in your side like his was, it's in your inside.  Anyway, it really bothered me that Newman might kill herself, because she - I - was the same person as me.  I used to tell her that, hoping that she would 'take it easy' (whatever that was supposed to mean!) for my sake.  She laughed ruefully.  In her own mind, she was cured, and on a quest.  Suicide wasn't the danger, &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;not understanding&lt;/span&gt; was, and it was a vivid enough danger that she stayed awake till four trying to finish the book in one sitting.  But that didn't help.  She's still trying to figure out what she's supposed to do next.  Phillip was content (apparently) to wait, but I know she won't be.

In the best republic, there is freedom of worship.  However, the Free Religion, in which everyone is bound to the dictates and commands of the leaders of the republic, is also mandated; Religious leaders have no right to tell people what would be good and right action.  "&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;The exercise of piety has to be accommodated to the peace and utility of the Republic and, consequently, be determined solely by the highest powers, who thus must be its interpreters as well.&lt;/span&gt;"  (19.1.2)  So in the best religion, there is freedom of obedience to the republic.  To allow this free pass to the state, Spinoza restricts the power of priests to encouraging 'true' Religion, defined as "&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;a simplicity and truthfulness of spirit,&lt;/span&gt;" which cannot be "&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;infused in human beings by an imperium of laws, nor by public authority.&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Further, absolutely no one can be compelled by force or by the laws to become blessed; but for this are required pious and brotherly admonition, good education, and, above all, one's own free judgement." &lt;/span&gt;(7.11.45-46)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus the most free and stable Republic and Religion are defined, and defined such that there is no conflict between them.  But however neatly defined, this unity is entirely impossible.  No Republic that acknowledges scripture or revelation can help but suffer at their hands.  Since the original Republic's noble lie, there have been a great many attempts to design the perfect state.  But, as in the original, inherent in the Republic of Spinoza's treatise is the seed of its own destruction.  Both in its theology and government, it cannot hope to face or control the beliefs which it readily allows and even invites into its citizenry&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spinoza explains convincingly that his god never acts except through second causes.  Which is to say, his philosophy is a naturalist one, opposed to the supernaturalists, who believe that gods (and/or wizards and fairies) cause actual magics or miracles, temporary exceptions to the otherwise omnipresent natural law.  According to a naturalist, all material things have material causes, investigable by reason.  That such a thing is possible, Spinoza credits to his god.  But he is nearly alone in this.  Naturalists familiar with physics and biochemistry of extant learning eventually find that they have no need to hypothesize any god to explain anything they encounter.  Spinoza is advancing a philosophy that tends to make its honest adherents eventually abandon it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By their nature, ideas are no less subject to natural selection than living things.  If the expression of a gene makes it less likely for its host to live long and to replicate that gene (perhaps , nature will select against it.  As generations pass, there will be fewer and fewer bearers of that gene.  Likewise, if the expression of some idea makes it less likely for its host to survive and/or spread it to others (perhaps some risky entertainment like cave diving, or a song only pleasant to a few people), then fewer heads will hold it as time goes passes.  In this view, an idea or group of ideas that simply spreads from person to person without changing their behavior much can be thought of as a typical virus, while a more complex interlinked collection of ideas that organizes people into a group is a like the genetic code of an animal, organizing multiple cells into an adapted body.  Religions, inasmuch as they organize societies, can be thought of as gene complexes of this sort, and the religious institutions they cause to be built can be thought of as animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any recognizable religion must include a broad variety of genes.  Most centrally, if we would even call it a religion, it must include positive supernatural claims, such as the existence of certain god or gods, and descriptions of their attributes, behaviors, and histories.  Beyond this, it includes genes which instruct its cells to indoctrinate their children, or even strangers, ensuring the animal's growth.  Other genes make cells to only coexist peacefully with other cells of the same animal, to encourage self-definition and violent dominance.  And some genes warn cells to mistrust free-floating idea viruses which will add new genes to the code.  Principles of dogmatic absolutism are like the genes of an immune system, making both the people who hold them, and the religions which inspire them, resistant to infection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spinoza's Free Religion, though not hazardous to the individual cells that carry it, does leave them extremely vulnerable to infection with a "no gods at all" virus, which makes it highly unlikely to survive, or at least, to survive as a religion.  Dogmatic religions which would make their adherents reject and avoid any evidence which invalidates their beliefs, are far more vigorous and likely to continue to "live."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But of course, the Free Religion does not have to support itself against its competitors.  The Free Republic, which permits no other group to interpret scripture, effectively permits no other religions to coexist with it except the Free.  Indeed, they are so intertwined that they are, in the eyes of those religions barred from their practices, a single thing, an inverse-theocracy, a true state religion.  However they (or we) might be leery of that idea, Spinoza argues that it is the only kind of religion that can be truly functional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="margin-left: 40px;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 85%;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;If someone now asked, however, what if the highest power commanded something contrary to religion and to the obedience that we have promised god by an express compact? - Is the human imperium to be complied with, or the divine?  But since I will deal with these things at more length in the following, here I only say briefly that, when we have a certain and indubitable revelation, God is to be obeyed above all.  But since human beings usually err in the greatest degree about religion and in view of the diversity of their mental casts fantasize many things with great contentiousness, as experience testifies more than enough, it is certain that if no one is bound to comply with the highest power in those things that he deems to pertain to religion , then the right of the city would depend on each's different judgement and emotion.  For no one who judged a statute to be contrary to his own faith and superstition would then be bound by it; and so, under this pretext, each could assume a license for everything.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-left: 40px;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 85%;"&gt;(16.8.17-19)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 85%;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And certainly, they do.  In our own country, there are not insignificant numbers of people who claim, in apparent seriousness, to have communication and/or commerce with the supernatural beings they worship.  In some cases, the actions of tens of thousands of people are determined by these messages from the beyond.  Not infrequently, commands are received from these beings, or individuals who speak for them, which are contrary to broadly accepted social norms.  In cases of conflict, very few of these worshipers would say that the authority of their government somehow supersedes that of their invisible masters.  As Spinoza explains, what people should do is to sceptically examine any such commands, wondering if their physical or mental failures are more likely than their being singled out as the bearer of an important message.  He also explains that the regularity and continuance of natural law results from divine will.  Thus, all things happen both because they are materially caused, and because they are what the appropriate god wills.  Whatever happens, happens by divine right.  Thus, his Republic claims the right to interpret scripture not merely as a practical concern, but also equates that practical control with a god-granted one.  It accepts into it's midst supernatural beliefs, appropriating them as a pillar of state, seeking to co-opt the hallucinations of its less self-examining citizens, and to put competing religious leaders out of business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, like genes and languages, religions naturally diverge.  Those which survive for any appreciable length of time do so because they counteract this tendency in some way.  For instance, not all proclaimed Catholics have the same beliefs or act the same way, but their doctrine establishes a centralized authority with the right to command and judge those beliefs and actions.  As long as there is a rigid structure-within-a-structure calcified at the heart of their religion, there is no question as to its coherency.  Their divergent believers can always be brought back to the apparently unified whole, or at least, defined in terms of it.  The power and continuity of the Vatican are mechanisms that exert a cohesive force, which makes them tend to create fewer "offspring" religions than otherwise.  Unlike with animals, there seems to be few practical limits to the size of religions, so having more children is not to their advantage; The fewer religions there are, the less competition there is for the resources they need.  If a religion has a less powerful collective force, then it has more children, which we would call more factions or sects.  As factions multiply, new and more vigorous offspring might take most or all of the worship of its more stolid parent.  Even if the state religion proposed in the treatise comes to be established, it does not have a strong centralizing force.  Though the government has the power to interpret scripture and legislate sacredness and to require participation in some rituals and disbars, Spinoza insists on granting each citizen, no matter how prone to delusion or lacking in reason, the right to believe what he likes and say what he believes.  That is, to think divergently, and to spread his divergence to others.  The Vatican can denounce worshipers for saying the wrong thing, which inhibits the spread of infectious ideas, as explained earlier.  Absolutist dogma prevents both the change and the multiplying of religion.  But unlike Catholicism, the Free Republic, free of both a mechanism for limiting offspring and of limiting infection, is a hothouse, a breeding ground for faction.  Anyone with a convincing enough story of a god telling them what to do will be able to spread it and, inasmuch as it spreads, to claim superiority to the story of the Republic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not only inevitable that such a state would eventually give rise to groups of citizens who believed that their interpretation of or communication with the invisible was superior to the Republic's ways.  It is also inevitable that some of those groups would be of a mind to overthrow it, and it is further inevitable, as long as the conditions permitting their possibility exist, that one such group will succeed.  It seems as if to claim that the state's power devolves to it from anything outside or above it is a recipe for disaster, as rebels compete to take that mantle of divine right onto their multitude of causes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 85%;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Using memetic theory without referring to outside texts proved a lengthy way to go.  Still, I'm more or less happy with how this turned out.]</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2006/12/and-let-reader-be-persuaded-for-himself.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/8184927543541219845'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/8184927543541219845'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2006/12/and-let-reader-be-persuaded-for-himself.html' title='Treasonous Faith'/><author><name>Nick Novitski</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08863651199447917923</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31707300.post-5420125922857645364</id><published>2006-10-24T14:19:00.002-04:00</published><updated>2009-03-02T22:25:35.991-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='actual play'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='gaming'/><title type='text'>In which a University Burns</title><content type='html'>No, not St John's.   We're not a university.  I speak of &lt;a href="http://bullypulpitgames.com/games/index.php?game=roach"&gt;Pemberton&lt;/a&gt;!  Two and a half weeks ago, I got some folks together to play the Shab-Al-Hiri roach.  It were fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I played Asst. Professor Lord Thomas Overton, of the Anthropology Department, specializing in the tribes of Northern Africa.  I was boring, so don't ask for further details.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Patrick played Asst. Professor Otto von Geinrich, of the Chemistry Department, specializing in properties of reactive gases, later made Full Professor despite multiple convictions for murder.  Patrick kicked off the game by wanting Geinrich to "accidentally" release mustard gas into the auditorium during commencement.  When I told him that mass murder might be best led up to, he decided that instead, in the middle of the Dean's speech, the hideously deformed and mutated (and bright purple) corpse of one of Geinrich's TAs drops from the rafters onto the stage. "So THAT'S where I was last night," thinks the drunken german idly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alyssa played Asst. Professor Richard Somerville Tradescent, of the Poetry &amp;amp; Drama Department, specializing in Romatic Poets.  Which Romantic Poets, you may well ask?  I assume you are familiar with the greats of the form?  The titans of their age?  Shakespeare, Shelley, Donne?  Well, that's not the sort that Mr. Tradescent studies, to the sorrow of those around him when he is either depressed or drunk.  He was both for much of the game, since as soon as Patrick suggested the idea of Geinrich's poisoned TA falling from the rafters, Alyssa immediately claimed that "obviously," he was a handsome young man that Richard had lately written a great deal of terrible poetry for/about.  He swore a quite florid revenge on the murderer and the world.  And he got both, of a kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Robert played Professor Reginal P. Babineaux III, of the Foreign &amp;amp; Ancient Languages Department, specializing in French ("Oh, but of course!").  Upon learning that the dead TA's grandfather was the chairman of the board of trustees, and planning on financing a new library, he had a plan.  "I haf sceene dees cinema reecently, eeht was cauled Weekahnd aht Berni's?"  The Grandfather's sudden death at the end of a long discussion (Alyssa's inspired idea) did not stop Reginald from getting his signature on the check.  He was a sniveling little backstabber, upon whom I wish a thousand deaths. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, good times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The game's official character sheets come with a chart of "Pembertonians," character's whose presence is required at certain points in the game.  These charts have two columns: Name, and Cause of Death.  In that spirit, and in order to avoid a play-by-play, I'll present a similar listing of various characters' final fates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Gordon Bumpus, President of the Board of Trustees&lt;/span&gt;: Drank antifreezed wine, dying before realizing the reason his son was dead, not just quiet and purple.  Posthumously, and some would say miraculously, donated a majority of his personal fortunes to the college, impoverishing his countless illegitimate children.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Arthur Steuben Ferguson, Chancellor&lt;/span&gt;: Still alive, and without criminal record.  Bastard.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;John Acton Gerard, Professor Emeritus&lt;/span&gt;: Killed by razor-studded bomb beneath his seat at Homecoming Football Game, which was, according to Geinrich, meant for someone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;L. Scott Collins, Young Radical Asst. Professor&lt;/span&gt;: Denounced as socialist in the midst of a tirade at the Founder's Day Wine &amp;amp; Cheese Social.  Arrested, and thereby not invited to the Gamma Gamma Gamma Christmas Ball, and thereby still alive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Regina Sutton, Most Popular Co-ed&lt;/span&gt;: Married to Lord Overton, and killed by roaches eating her young and beautiful brain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Campbell Stoudenmeyer, Faculty Senate Chair&lt;/span&gt;: Because of stupid name, not invited to Gamma Gamma Gamma's (hastily renamed) Regina Overton Memorial Christmas Ball, and therefore alive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Rev. Gaylord Talley, Chaplain&lt;/span&gt;: Killed by Baudelaire.  Well, the savage beating might have had something to do with it, but I know what I think, regardless of what the Medical Examiners had to say.  Which was nothing, considering how well the body was hidden.  I think Tradescent might have eaten it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Manley Wakefield-Nutter&lt;/span&gt;: Dean of Students: Killed by fire at Christmas Ball.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Bantam Whaley, Panthercats Quarterback&lt;/span&gt;: Awakened to ancient roach-hunting instincts from unknown Sumerian Rebel ancestry when he came into Professor Tradescent's office to ask about the poor marks on his recent sonnet assignment, only to be confronted with the sight of the form the professor had pupated into during his stay at the asylum, a giant cockroach-humanoid.  These instincts, unfortunately, did not save him from being killed by fire at the Christmas Ball.  In fact, since it was his instinctively attacking Tradescent with a lacrosse stick in a fit of such savage fury that the terrified roach-man had no option but to skitter across the campus, eventually arriving at the Christmas ball and lighting itself and any number of other people and things on fire from knocking over scads of torches, which, as the party was being held in the open air of St. Luke's Cemetery, so as to be near Regina's grave, were thought both necessary and suitably festive/somber, and tracking fire over everything, including the church itself, causing the deaths of an estimated 98% of the student body and 87% of the faculty, you could say that it was his own stupid fault.  I think.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Professor Geinrich&lt;/span&gt;: Made Dean.  Series of reformations eventually lead to Pemberton being renamed "The Citadel."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Professor Tradescent&lt;/span&gt;: Last seen buzzing through the skies southwest, either to his ancestral home in Louisiana, or to West Virginia.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Professor Badinaux&lt;/span&gt;: Made head of his department, but that turns to ashes in his mouth when he remembers a German gives him orders.  Hilarity ensues!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Professor Overton&lt;/span&gt;: Went back to the bloodthirsty sands of North Africa, where the world makes sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Great stuff.

Toast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daniel said some wonderful things about it on the mailing list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I'll begin by saying I liked the game enough to dish out $45 to buy it.  This being capitalist-America and all, that is likely the strongest endorsement that is most easily understood by the largest amount of people.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Okay, so that wasn't really one of the wonderful things.

Even ignoring the less-good examples of the form that the article is mocking, trying to determine &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; use a limited set of programmed interactions is not everyone's idea of fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let us presume a game of a sufficiently defined and determined nature, such that everyone who reads the book has the same understanding of what you do when you play.  In any given situation that is open to player input, all the available options have to be mentally parsed.  I've seen play break down here several times, especially with new players and systems with lots of options.  Some people will remember the classic example: "Can I cast a spell?  I want to cast...magic missile!  I attack the darkness!"  Etc. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, it's not a phenomenon limited to D20.  If you're going around the table for scenes in PTA, you're really asking for a choice from an indefinite option set.  Confronted with the need to come up with something on the spot, some people are going to wish they had a list to choose from, even if it was a long one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the real problem is that no one comes to the table equally.  Even presuming everyone at the table read all the way through the book (hah!), they've had different experiences with different games before this one, and that's what's going to influence their expectations more than anything else.  The D20 family of products capitalizes on this, or at least attempts to.  In contrast, indy games sometimes remind me of board games, with their widely divergent types of play.  Inasmuch as they are games of the same sort, playing Risk should teach you how to play Settlers of Catan, but how?  It seems like it would only inform behavior.  That is, a man who played nothing but Risk most of his life might, confronted with Settlers, look to those elements apparently held in common (resources collected, little colored pieces of wood) and tend to expand aggressively.  He's not stupid (not if he's good at Risk!), and he knows that Settlers is a different game, but he's not as familiar with it as he'd like to be, and if he doesn't see a way to apply his practiced behaviors in this new rules environment, he's going to get just as anxious and frustrated as someone new to the game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this isn't the only possible reaction.  The first time my mother played Settlers of Catan, about two years ago, she jokingly groused how little she understood of it.  The whole way though the game.  Right up till when she won.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, I'm not bitter.  Yes, I'd still like a rematch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, a game, as a social setting, carries an implicit social threat.  A new game is like the first day of school: Plenty of people can't help but see the whole experience as series of minefield to navigate.  People get pretty worried about doing things &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;wrong&lt;/span&gt;. Someone in the group probably knows the game better than they do, and if you're playing with these people, you probably like them a little and care whether they like you a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And with caring comes &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;fear&lt;/span&gt;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this fear is what prompts behavior contrary to the stated intent of a 'new' game.  We try to fall back on behaviors whose success we've experienced, however inappropriate.  To avoid this and properly approach a game, you have to be game.  You have to be de-invested in your performance.  You have to be, like the Fonz and my mother, always cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the next question is, how to encourage this state in players?</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2006/08/inactive-fiction.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/1860109606088491570'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/1860109606088491570'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2006/08/inactive-fiction.html' title='Inactive Fiction'/><author><name>Nick Novitski</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08863651199447917923</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31707300.post-3648216416740212934</id><published>2006-07-27T23:29:00.000-04:00</published><updated>2006-09-03T17:25:32.015-04:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='ethics'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='gaming'/><title type='text'>Playing = Making Friends</title><content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://www.next-gen.biz/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;amp;amp;id=3518&amp;Itemid=2"&gt;Next Generation - Can Games Make You Cry?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fan-TAS-tic article.

Historically, there are a limited number of ways a computer-assisted game will come up as a subject of conversation in the &lt;a href="http://forum.rpg.net/forumdisplay.php?f=3"&gt;Open forum&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;"I like playing this game!

If you can't appeal to kids more than flashing lights on a screen can, you're toast."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Off-topic Post reported."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;Thanks to Google Reader, I'm tracking about 180 different websites.  About equal numbers of them are devoted to physical gaming and virtual gaming.  I play plenty of video games, but not having gone to a technical school, physical gaming is closer to my heart and future earnings potential.  So why the even split?  Well, as communities, they're not so different as you might think.  Notably, there is a sense in certain quarters that a new kind of thinking is required to make the next kind of video-game, using techniques and approaches as-yet-unheard-of.   One of the approaches is even to be found in a nascent Indie movement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the real story is in practical application.  I find that, despite their best efforts, the blogs of these video game designers have given me immense lateral insight into some of the questions I try to address in physical-game play and design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To back up my point, I will discuss a single post from a single video-game blog that made its way instantly into my starred items list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tadgh of &lt;a href="http://particleblog.blogspot.com/2006/07/stories-structure-abstraction-and.html"&gt;Particleblog&lt;/a&gt; has decided that "interactive story" is a paradox.  The concept, he says, was based on the supposition that, since stories are structures (and epic stories are Campbellian Hero-quests), they can be produced and adjusted by a sufficiently complicated mechanic (running on a sufficiently complicated computer, of course). However, he asserts that though...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;...all stories start with a rough framework in mind (such as Campbell), they then become more and more delicately structured on their own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example, sub-plotting and character arcs are part of a story's structure. Symbolic development is part of a story's structure. Scene construction and pacing are part of a story's structure. The more carefully structured a story becomes, the more individuated from the basic framework it becomes. The more that happens, the more it departs from any sort of specific rules of story construction, and the more that that happens, the better the story becomes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All stories are indeed structures, but what the interactive storytelling community have failed to appreciate is that all the &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;best&lt;/span&gt; stories are &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;brittle&lt;/span&gt; structures.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Well and good.  Of course, the networked array of neural-net processors we call the gaming group has several advantages here over the computers that Tadgh is imagining.  First, like TCP/IP, we are able to cope with lossy communications; Not everyone in the group is going to be fully dedicated to producing a story &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;all &lt;/span&gt;the time, but those who are focused on that activity breeze past the mental presence or absence of other players.  I can have an intense experience alone in an rpg.  In fact, thanks to not realizing that other people might have different gaming priorities than me, I bet most of my intense roleplaying experiences have been lonely ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, human computers are pretty goddamn powerful, and they are specialists in organizing patterns, and stories, I don't mind affirming, are patterns and patterns only.  The Things Which Have Happened are not a story, but what we create with them will be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moving on, Tadgh blames the "the perpetuation of the idea that games and stories are converging" on &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Rein-Hagen"&gt;Mark Rein*Hagen&lt;/a&gt;!  White Wolf's rebranding called adventures "stories" and campaigns "chronicles" and GMs "storytellers,"  resulting in the following brain-damaged chain of reasoning:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;* Movies and games must be coming closer together because games have storytelling in them, and therefore characters and arcs&lt;br /&gt;* The story of Chess exists because games and stories are linked. Since Chess has no audience, the story of Chess must therefore be a story that the players are telling to themselves&lt;br /&gt;* And since stories are structures it therefore follows that since Chess is also a structure, and since games and stories are connected, that some kind of interactive storytelling engine is possible.&lt;br /&gt;* So I can play storytelling games without the need for a Storyteller&lt;/blockquote&gt;It seems reasonable.  In fact, having read Polaris, it seems inevitable.  But, playing without a storyteller means, in this case, playing only and exactly according to the prewritten rules.  Every roleplaying game I've seen "without a GM" really just shares GMing duty, or more specifically, the right to Veto.  In order to enhance enjoyment, sometimes we don't play by the rules every single little time.  But Tadgh would say that in a normal and complete and good game, there are rules and rules alone.  Chess.  Football/Soccer.  You could get touchy-feely and let people do takebacks or not count clearly unintentional handballs, but inasmuch as you were doing that, you'd just be screwing around and not playing the game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Essentially, a GM is like a king, if sometimes a benevolent or effectively constrained one.  GMless games (Chess, Football) are more like the rule of law.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tadgh then (independantly?) discovers the impossible thing before breakfast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;And also missing out on one more thing. Rein*Hagen's games were never really "storytelling" games in the first place.  They are roleplaying games, just as D+D, Call of Cthulhu and Paranoia. Tabletop roleplaying games are not storytelling experiences, they are shared fantasies with a fluid and robust structure which share a fiction but not a story.&lt;/blockquote&gt;He defines a game:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;A game (of any stripe) is an abstract space with robust rules in which one or more participants is able to take any kind of action subject to the constraints of that space toward a pre-determined goal. &lt;/blockquote&gt;Games are best when their rules are simplest, allowing for the maximum freedom within those rules (Chess, Football).  They sometimes produce emotional experiences, and sometimes don't.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;In a tabletop roleplaying game, when the quest is on and the players are trying to figure out a way to storm the Castle Perilous, the rules may appear complicated, but the Games Master is on hand to short-cut all of the tedious bits, make arbitrary decisions that move the pace on a bit and otherwise get the game going where it needs to go. The Games Master acts as a counter-weight for elegance and robustness. Sometimes this provides moments of real drama. Sometimes it doesn't.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And so too in videogames. Deathmatch games of Counterstrike are no different to games of football, quest games like God of War are no different either. You have the space, the challenge and the abstraction that makes it possible to play within well-understood boundaries. To call this 'story' is utterly ludicrous.&lt;/blockquote&gt;My approach to enjoyment has been eviscerated!  What is left me?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;What games have, on the other hand, is fictions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fiction is a shorthand term that says "the imaginative character of the spaces in which games are played". All game spaces have character of some shape or description. Chess and football have a symbolic character, Tetris likewise. That is the sum total of their fictions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many games have more complicated fictions than this. Vampire: The Masquerade's setting, the World of Darkness, is a very long and involved fiction. Final Fantasy VII's is likewise. Most games fall somewhere in the middle in terms of complexity. The best games are those that mirror fiction and gameplay together to create a robust, elegant game that the players can functionally play with relative ease and symbolically/imaginatively enjoy likewise. Football would not be football with the crowd chants, it would be anemic. Paranoia would not be Paranoia without the whole "Glory Glory the Computer" songs and Resident Evil would not be Resident Evil without the zombiefied villagers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The big difference between recognising the qualities of a fiction and misinterpreting it as am interactive story experience is in seeing that the system underpinning the fiction is robust (i.e. it's an abstract game) and therefore the best fictions are always the ones that are driven at the player's behest. Chess would simply be irritating if after every five moves a neutral judge read out lines of poetry, and many videogames are irritating because of their long ponderous cut-scenes that serve no purpose in advancing the gameplay or exploring the fiction. Great fiction always works at the behest of the player in a manner that furthers their exploration and advancement of their gameplay.&lt;/blockquote&gt;And if that doesn't give you something to think about, I'll eat my hat.  And I don't have a hat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several responses to this post were also star-worthy.  I especially liked the one at &lt;a href="http://grandtextauto.gatech.edu/2006/07/24/sandcastle-construction/"&gt;Grand Text Auto&lt;/a&gt; (Yeah, Georgia Tech!

It's pretty easy to dismiss that as ignorance, especially considering Ebert confessed in the same breath that he doesn't play any.  But he had his reasons.  To whit:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Video games by their nature require player choices, which is the opposite of the strategy of serious film and literature, which requires authorial control.    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="indent1"&gt;I am prepared to believe that video games can be elegant, subtle, sophisticated, challenging and visually wonderful. But I believe the nature of the medium prevents it from moving beyond craftsmanship to the stature of art. To my knowledge, no one in or out of the field has ever been able to cite a game worthy of comparison with the great dramatists, poets, filmmakers, novelists and composers. That a game can aspire to artistic importance as a visual experience, I accept. But for most gamers, video games represent a loss of those precious hours we have available to make ourselves more cultured, civilized and empathetic. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div class="indent1"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, so that's still easy to dismiss.  I've experienced plenty of work by "the great dramatists,&lt;br /&gt;poets, etc," and I know that plenty of it was just as commercialized, popular among the young and broadly reviled by proponents of the previous order when it was young and new, from Dickens to Tolstoy, from Plato to Dante.   I know further that this re-occurrent principle does not degrade their eternal value, but rather elevates any number of modern works, including certain games, to the same exalted status.  Further, considering the face-time, social contract and, more and more often, sophisticated thematic resonances of non-computer-mediated RPGs (which are what I hope to principally consider), the "cultured, civilized and empathetic" complaint falls flat.  People who don't have emotional reactions to playing &lt;a href="http://www.septemberquestion.org/lumpley/"&gt;Dogs in the Vineyard&lt;/a&gt; belong in the DSM-IV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Ron Gilbert, &lt;a href="http://grumpygamer.com/"&gt;super-happy-famous-succesful designer person&lt;/a&gt;, immediately agreed with Ebert (that Art does require Authorial Control), then refocused the conversation on what he saw as the important point.  It was a move to would have done my &lt;a href="http://www.stjohnscollege.edu/asp/main.aspx?page=1303"&gt;seminar&lt;/a&gt; tutor's proud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I think games both need &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;and have&lt;/span&gt; Authorial Control.  There has to be someone at the helm who is giving us their vision for the experience.  Movies have a Director, Books have a Author, and Games have a Designer (titles in games in a complex issue I won't get into here). &lt;br /&gt;I don't think Roger has thought about this.  He sees toys and doesn't see the person or people behind them and that is our fault (dear lord... when will we stop screwing up). &lt;br /&gt;Take GTA:SA.  Who designed it?  I don't know.  I could probably look it up but I won't because I shouldn't have to.  During the debate about GTA, where was the designer?  Why was he or she not speaking out, letting us know why they did things the way they did, defending their art?  Did I miss it? &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;During the controversy surrounding &lt;a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0110632"&gt;Natural Born Killers&lt;/a&gt;, Oliver Stone was very vocal about the film and his vision behind it. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;This is why the games industry needs more visibility to the people behind the games.  It is this humanizing that will ultimately pull them into the realm of art.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This humanizing visibility I call &lt;i&gt;Voice&lt;/i&gt;.  The term refers both the vocalness Mr Gilbert calls for and to the distinctive stamp a Creator puts on a Work.  I see Spike Lee as the poster-boy of this theorized combination; I think he proves that both are two sides of the same coin of strongly presented Identity.  Now, it is possible to say that both of these factors are less strongly present in gaming products than in other media, but since RPGs haven't had to defend themselves from the Self-Appointed Arbiters of Culture for a decade or so, what really hit me, reading all this, was the latter factor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Open up the D&amp;amp;D 3.5 player's handbook and try to tell me about Authorial Control, try to tell me something about the people responsible for its creation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to their convention and creative preference, we have expectations from a movie by M. Night Shyamalan, a book by William Gibson, a song by Thom Yorke, or a comic by Grant Morrison.  Creative works don't tell us everything about these people, but they do tell us how these people approach creative works, and in the case of gaming, when "experiencing" the work means taking your own approach, knowing what the voice of the author has to say is very important.  Probably inherently more important than in non-interactive art forms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Independent RPGs have had voice in spades.  Reading &lt;a href="http://www.sorcerer-rpg.com/"&gt;Sorceror&lt;/a&gt; is, for long passages, very similar to listening to Ron Edwards talk very honestly and clearly about how he thinks about gaming, and the same is (only slightly less) true for any number of other games.  Over the Edge is the earliest game I know of to have included essays on the subject right alongside the conventional material, and many of the indie writers admit to being directly or indirectly inspired by him.  Their work is personable and heartfelt, engaging for anyone who likes to feel respected as an intelligent co-creator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, there is also an impulse to do the opposite.  Common wisdom says that adding Voice reduces professionalism.  Journalists at &lt;a href="http://nytimes.com/"&gt;real newspapers&lt;/a&gt; will tell you to save that kind of halfassery for a Column, or better yet, the Letters page, or better yet, your cute little blog back home.  They say that art loses its soul when it becomes rich, but I say that work becomes navel-gazing when it becomes soulful.  However important approach may be to rpgs, if you are writing a game and not a collection of critical essays on the state of the art, you need to recall the purpose of every word and page as the play you hope to help people create. Trust your educated and interested readers to be able to understand what they are supposed to do, if your rules and examples are clear enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: I just saw that Chad Underkoffler talked about this in &lt;a href="http://chadu.livejournal.com/415255.html"&gt;his review of vs. Monsters&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is a razor's edge that people don't always know that indie designers are treading.  Games aren't newspapers, but there still is an abyss yawning on the soulful side.  Fall in, and you end up with &lt;a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/113758"&gt;Empire of Satanis&lt;/a&gt; or the more self-congratulatory bits of &lt;a href="http://www.fatalgames.com/"&gt;FATAL&lt;/a&gt;.  A tightly-knit group bites its own tail and produces subsidiary production cycles from a central cyclonic forum spin, which gather some new ideas and new participants before feeding them back into the Conversation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But don't think I'm trying to warn anyone.  I think this inbreeding (note to self: find better word) is a very good thing.  In fact, it's the reason I assume the hobby won't die. As briefly noted in the previous post, on the internet, things tend to succeed in the long run based on the accessibility of the public face of its author.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On Voice, in other words.  Personality without ego, confidence without arrogance, accessibility without pandering or demagoguery, content full of character and character entertaining enough to be content.  I know nothing about the men and women who make Dungeons and Dragons, but it takes very little to know a great deal about the developers of any creator-owned content, those whose voice is self-regulated and not other-restricted.  I think that's why the indie manifestos have weight for me: We've all seen the results before in the webcomic and not-web comic publishing industries.</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2006/09/voice.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/3288818796897357011'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/3288818796897357011'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2006/09/voice.html' title='Voice'/><author><name>Nick Novitski</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08863651199447917923</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31707300.post-8700508588124724508</id><published>2006-07-22T20:58:00.000-04:00</published><updated>2006-11-28T17:38:47.776-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='gaming'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='neologism'/><title type='text'>These times in which I am fortunate enough to live</title><content type='html'>There exists a &lt;a href="http://www.mega64.com/"&gt;show&lt;/a&gt; that, having hatched from its cable access birthing cocoon, rose on wings of viral marketing and converging demographic graph lines to be, to some, myself not the least of which, hilarious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if you don't know their story, you've heard &lt;a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/"&gt;something like it&lt;/a&gt; before.&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;2&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;guys working both figuratively and literally out of their garage make something they think is great.  Somehow, one of the Internet's ten thousand tentacles happen up this great thing and latch hold, drawing it into the nearest toothless tongueless maw.  Suddenly, &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;X&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;years have gone by, and now they are heralded as geniuses by adoring fans world wide, and paid genuine money by companies that do actual work to promote a real product.  Checks fill mailboxes past their ISO-tested limits, metal straining from the sheer mass of selloutitude.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not that I would ever complain.  They need to eat as much as the next guy.  They're living the dream, and I'm happy for them, because all of the guys who fit into this Hero's Journey succeeded because on some level or another, they were likeable.  18-25 year-olds, people whose attention is valuable in large numbers (and we should be proud to be so sought-after!) liked them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, to take the first crawling steps towards a point, this particular great thing, this Mega64, is something of a love-letter to games that have had time to mature in the haze of our childhood memories.  The premise is (if you don't know and found the link above unappetizing) that two hapless souls are forced to endure their perceptions of Self and Other being warped through the cracked lens of various video games.  But, as I have said, none of these video games are, in the industry's terms, &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;.   Only games that were on the NES in some form can fit with the tone of ironic nostalgia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Unless they had a funny idea about Banjo Kazooie.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I grew up playing Tetris, Rampage and Snake Rattle and Roll, Dr. Mario, Duckhunt and Paperboy.  The glories and agonies of those epics will absolutely never leave me.  They are my Chanson du Roland, my Epic of Gilgamesh and my Odyssey (or Iliad, more like), and they are the bedrock and wellspring of the way I approach &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;entertainment itself&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this is not news to you, Gentle Reader.  Statistics let me assume you are of a certain age, male, white, and that you have played video games more than once in your life.  We share this same memory and see it together, though from different angles.  And in those angles, it looms large.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But anyone who's ever fooled around with &lt;a href="http://www.mame.net/"&gt;MAME&lt;/a&gt; knows there were times before ours, an age before ours.   And to the men of that iron age, that wolf age, the youths of Mega64 made a &lt;a href="http://www.mega64.com/e31975.htm"&gt;tribute&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The climactic moment is the product catalog of "E3 '75."  Old video games are easy to mock, standing next to their descendants, and how much more so the very oldest ones?   I admit that pong is, by my standards today, only just barely a game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But between &lt;a href="http://www.mame.net/"&gt;MAME&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://fceultra.sourceforge.net/"&gt;FCE Utlra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://zsnes.ipherswipsite.com/"&gt;zsnes&lt;/a&gt;, a history of gaming the Smithsonian would not be ashamed of has been at my beck and call for several years.  I am no stranger to the dustier exhibits in the less flashy wings.  Sometimes when I fiddle with Centipede or Frogger or Zelda or Street Fighter 2, I think "I could be playing &lt;a href="http://www.galciv2.com/"&gt;GalCiv&lt;/a&gt; right now."  But other times, I feel the world quiet and something cool pour down my spine, and I think  "When this was made, there was nothing like it.  People played it, and it was the first time for them and everyone else."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know what those people felt, because I feel it a lot lately.  It's possible that any attempt to predict sea changes of that sort is laughably futile, but I can't shake the frequent sense that something I am reading, watching or interacting with is unlike anything else thus far.  Even if most of these many unique things do not each father its own breed, any one can jolt people who love it to learn something new about what's possible, and to add new colors to the palate, techniques to the arsenal, and dimensions to the medium.</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2006/07/these-times-in-which-i-am-fortunate.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/8700508588124724508'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/8700508588124724508'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2006/07/these-times-in-which-i-am-fortunate.html' title='These times in which I am fortunate enough to live'/><author><name>Nick Novitski</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08863651199447917923</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31707300.page-3675681273244765002</id><published>2010-10-04T18:26:00.000-04:00</published><updated>2011-02-14T11:23:46.126-05:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#page'/><title type='text'>About</title><content type='html'>I am an outwardly mobile unprofessional&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For professional inquiries, please refer to my profile on LinkedIn.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/pages/default/3675681273244765002'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/pages/default/3675681273244765002'/><author><name>Nick Novitski</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08863651199447917923</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31707300.post-115499561920297091</id><published>2006-08-07T20:06:00.000-04:00</published><updated>2006-08-07T20:06:59.203-04:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment'/><title type='text'>Having information of yourself that you didn't exp...</title><content type='html'>Having information of yourself that you didn't explicitly consent to being available, be in the hands of someone making a decision about you is bad.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Why bad?  Because people make decisions, and they aren't necessarily good at it.  People that are moderately good at it find (or ask for) information relevant to their decision and use that.  People that are really good at it ONLY use that information.  The rest have poor judgement in that they have prejudices (consciously or not).&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;So you think you have nothing to hide?  You simply don't believe that anything you do can reasonably prejudice someone against you.  But you can't rely on people to be reasonable, and you certainly can't rely on them to use information about you for your own benefit.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Information about me may have value, but if it does, then they should negotiate with me in trading for it.

However, it does seem that we, if we would be who we wish ourselves to be, and by that I mean, if we act on the principle of allowing rational beings to make informed decisions about their own lives and live them out, then it seems there is little we can do except ignore those who do not wish to participate in the world we live in. They have chosen to isolate themselves and stay where they are, and since they will not participate, they might as well not exist. Sad, because of the loss of potential that those people represent, but there doesn't seem to be any other option.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/380293665093290704/comments/default/5448057510320809033'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/380293665093290704/comments/default/5448057510320809033'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2007/06/writing-makes-you-smarter-reading-makes.html?showComment=1183152240000#c5448057510320809033' title=''/><author><name>Ben</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07015315349960683809</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2007/06/writing-makes-you-smarter-reading-makes.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31707300.post-380293665093290704' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/380293665093290704' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.itemClass' value='pid-1488967715'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.displayTime' value='June 29, 2007 5:24 PM'/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31707300.post-1537427757151871166</id><published>2007-09-02T21:45:00.000-04:00</published><updated>2007-09-02T21:45:21.735-04:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment'/><title type='text'>And you say I'm the one who writes well.</title><content type='html'>And you say I'm the one who writes well.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/4941445020304971626/comments/default/1537427757151871166'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/4941445020304971626/comments/default/1537427757151871166'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2007/08/first-sight-of-miami.html?showComment=1188783900000#c1537427757151871166' title=''/><author><name>Ben</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07015315349960683809</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2007/08/first-sight-of-miami.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31707300.post-4941445020304971626' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/4941445020304971626' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.itemClass' value='pid-1488967715'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.displayTime' value='September 02, 2007 9:45 PM'/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31707300.post-4583648888583042937</id><published>2008-02-13T23:52:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2008-02-13T23:52:32.145-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment'/><title type='text'>"When role-playing games were (or are) variations ...</title><content type='html'>"When role-playing games were (or are) variations on the tactical war-game, music would distract players from the explicit purpose of planning moves for maximizing your side's advantage.

In fact, its presence is demanded, at least by me."&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Now it becomes clear to me (or at least more clear). I don't want to play games whose purpose is emotionally focused. I'm not interested in playing games where the entire purpose of the game is to induce or be induced into specific emotional states.

You've got him/me there!&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Have you ever read an "introduction to roleplaying" that mentions Cowboys and Indians?  That used to be the go-to example back in the day, since the expectation was for roleplaying games to center around group violence, just like "Cowboys and Indians" did (in my youth, we just called it "gun fighting," as distinct from "karate fighting").&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Anyway, these examples frequently claimed that &lt;EM&gt;the central problem&lt;/EM&gt; of Cowboys and Indians was the following exchange, rewrote dozens of times in dozens of books.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;First child: "Bang!"&lt;BR/&gt;Second child: "You missed!"&lt;BR/&gt;First child: "It seems we disagree!"&lt;BR/&gt;Second child: "If only we had reliable and portable random number generators and actuarial tables to judge the likelihood of the outcomes in question!"&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;Okay, they didn't have that bit at the end as part of the hypothetical problem.  The impression actually given was that the writers of all these books were always the ones on the playground that grew red-faced with fury when other people "cheated" and chose to ignore their imaginary deaths in favor of continuing to run around saying "Bang bang!" a lot.  Hence, they graciously provided us with a system for arbitration.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;My point is, the provision of &lt;STRONG&gt;any&lt;/STRONG&gt; rules can be seen as a lack of &lt;STRONG&gt;some&lt;/STRONG&gt; trust.  I could (and do) say that &amp;quot;Real/experienced/good/correct Cowboys and Indians players can be trusted to roll with the tempo of the fun and play dead or not as appropriate.  These rules are incomprehensible, made for the whiners who can&amp;#39;t take the awesomeness of our game.&amp;quot;&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;I think the problem becomes that D&amp;amp;D (say) isn&amp;#39;t Cowboys and Indians with more rules, any more than American football is Rugby with more rules.  The two are different games, whose successful play does not equate.  The games&amp;#39; package of rules-logic provides a platform for play, a starting (and sometimes ending) point for achieving whatever you would personally enjoy.  And you separate out the parts of the logic, as individual rules (or their absence) are each little proposals for more readily reaching the level of mental and/or social and/or physical (depending on the game) interaction that the players (who are also designers) want.  &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;What&amp;#39;s the difference between &amp;quot;no rust monsters&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;bishops only move diagonally&amp;quot;?  I don&amp;#39;t think there is one, except in a general perception of one as a guideline and the other as received and accepted wisdom.  But in truth, the two are equally as only useful as you find them, and equally (I assume on behalf of chess&amp;#39; &amp;quot;creator&amp;quot;) consciously chosen for their effect on play. Rust monsters are removed from gm&amp;#39;s vocabulary in order to decrease the incidence of &amp;quot;genuine fear&amp;quot; (according to others: also &amp;quot;genuine annoyance&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;genuine boredom&amp;quot;) they apparently are responsible for.  Players are given the ability to shape the game world through wagers and permissive rules in order to increase the amount of investment and fun they all have.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;We&amp;#39;re all on the same side, despite having our distinct preferences.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/462431099956757079/comments/default/2893891072475973356'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/462431099956757079/comments/default/2893891072475973356'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2008/09/houses-of-blooded-sale-and-first.html?showComment=1221343800000#c2893891072475973356' title=''/><author><name>Nick Novitski</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08863651199447917923</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2008/09/houses-of-blooded-sale-and-first.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31707300.post-462431099956757079' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/462431099956757079' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.itemClass' value='pid-1081303302'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.displayTime' value='September 13, 2008 6:10 PM'/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31707300.post-5645923046345005047</id><published>2008-10-26T02:30:00.000-04:00</published><updated>2008-10-26T02:30:29.439-04:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment'/><title type='text'>That was an awesome read.</title><content type='html'>That was an awesome read.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/5601383648374547410/comments/default/5645923046345005047'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/5601383648374547410/comments/default/5645923046345005047'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2008/09/now-hear-this.html?showComment=1225002600000#c5645923046345005047' title=''/><author><name>Ben</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07015315349960683809</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2008/09/now-hear-this.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31707300.post-5601383648374547410' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/5601383648374547410' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.itemClass' value='pid-1488967715'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.displayTime' value='October 26, 2008 2:30 AM'/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31707300.post-4812073358997223299</id><published>2008-10-30T10:42:00.000-04:00</published><updated>2008-10-30T10:42:20.738-04:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment'/><title type='text'>&lt;a href="http://www.blogger.com/profile/0728479269...</title><content type='html'>&lt;A HREF="http://www.blogger.com/profile/07284792696152512441" REL="nofollow"&gt;Spammer number two&lt;/A&gt;, and on the same post, no less!

He may even surpass his master and become more Michael Bey than Bey Himself...</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/2451377368489133477/comments/default/2663409229121734087'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/2451377368489133477/comments/default/2663409229121734087'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2009/10/things-you-can-learn-from-having-tv.html?showComment=1254773100691#c2663409229121734087' title=''/><author><name>buddha</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/09179083752402317236</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='22' src='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_6DvwSm0Q4E8/SWtXHpoIbxI/AAAAAAAAAAM/dKcibFbtQ9o/S220-s32/Gasp.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2009/10/things-you-can-learn-from-having-tv.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31707300.post-2451377368489133477' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/2451377368489133477' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.itemClass' value='pid-70848027'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.displayTime' value='October 05, 2009 4:05 PM'/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31707300.post-4218470704541323263</id><published>2009-10-05T16:06:02.482-04:00</published><updated>2009-10-05T16:06:02.482-04:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment'/><title type='text'>Bay-zlebub.</title><content type='html'>Bay-zlebub.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/2451377368489133477/comments/default/4218470704541323263'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/2451377368489133477/comments/default/4218470704541323263'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2009/10/things-you-can-learn-from-having-tv.html?showComment=1254773162482#c4218470704541323263' title=''/><author><name>Nick Novitski</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08863651199447917923</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2009/10/things-you-can-learn-from-having-tv.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31707300.post-2451377368489133477' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/2451377368489133477' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.itemClass' value='pid-1081303302'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.displayTime' value='October 05, 2009 4:06 PM'/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31707300.post-1808984679170668661</id><published>2009-10-05T18:13:15.643-04:00</published><updated>2009-10-05T18:13:15.643-04:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment'/><title type='text'>i thought it was fun....</title><content type='html'>i thought it was fun....</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/2451377368489133477/comments/default/1808984679170668661'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/2451377368489133477/comments/default/1808984679170668661'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2009/10/things-you-can-learn-from-having-tv.html?showComment=1254780795643#c1808984679170668661' title=''/><author><name>Sara</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/01883337870072550463</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2009/10/things-you-can-learn-from-having-tv.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31707300.post-2451377368489133477' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/2451377368489133477' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.itemClass' value='pid-811106262'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.displayTime' value='October 05, 2009 6:13 PM'/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31707300.post-4461878159377271793</id><published>2009-10-06T15:46:55.824-04:00</published><updated>2009-10-06T15:46:55.824-04:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment'/><title type='text'>Any flaws that stood out as needing correction?

I thought it was awesome when my &amp;quot;I am loved&amp;quot; Gift got bumped up to Strong in Truth, Mechanical Support, and Valence! Suddenly I was seen as a threat by the very people who were helping me find the Jewel! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think there are some unspoken bits in WTF that we were just discovering, like the ability to &amp;quot;change&amp;quot; my own gift&amp;#39;s wording at the end of the session being usurped by Sam because everyone can get in on a roll...  But in a game where the rules themselves can be changed by the players, I&amp;#39;m sure there&amp;#39;s lots of interactions that will remain unseen until someone goes... wait a minute, I can just do this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In regards to rewording the Gifts... I think we just weren&amp;#39;t sure when and where they applied... Like Mechanical Support.  Since the only mechanics we had were Attribute rolls, I wasn&amp;#39;t sure where that Support came in.  Is it purely narrative? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it really was fun, and I am absolutely up for playing again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for a great game, Jenna K.

We had six players, and if you would sniff up two dice then you were more than likely to want to roll and add detail to the setting. this had some consequences: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. We rolled allot. too much? i don&amp;#39;t know. &lt;br /&gt;2. The Setting did not feel unified as a Judgment on the W,T, and/or F. It was a mishmash of interests. &lt;br /&gt;3. The gifts, though used to define the fiction and Inform the Narrative (I like the idea of a personification of a story in that saying), were swallowed whole by the power of Dice. A power of Dice that never faded, never dulled, and really, it was 5 on 1. The gifts were eaten and had little direct concrete effect. (this is something me and Nick disagree on, i think; the effect of the Gifts on the story as developed). &lt;br /&gt;4. The Insight Attribute became less a tool of Moral judgement and correcting the vision of the Wisher, and more of a hmm.. I lost the Knowledge Roll, now I will use Insight. the players held back from this, but the two of us that had Insight as our main stat, found that with many many of the facts defined by fellow players it seemed bad form (to steal a phrase) to just undo what they had done without allowing it to develop and be addressed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say that we made our Gifts with the Idea that they were not really Benifits in mind. I took four, with the knowledge that three of them had Weaknesses that should be exploited. and that the fourth should be a case of twoo much of what you ask for. but they did not come into play much as narration or as rules. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, with 6 players, unless you are very sharp it is hard to maintain all the Gifts out there in your head. maybe with six players the players SHOULD have less Gifts, even if just t help focus the game and allow for us average joes to remeber whats in play. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of my initial responses. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a fascinating game. I would play again. I thought up a number of &amp;quot;fixes&amp;quot; but most of them make the game just slightly more complex and may not fix anything. and I liked the simplicity of the system tied with the unkindled nature of the world. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jason L</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/1760836993374988000/comments/default/7300828085925346802'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/1760836993374988000/comments/default/7300828085925346802'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2009/10/wtf-actual-play.html?showComment=1254861524433#c7300828085925346802' title=''/><author><name>Jason</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/14589050535156917920</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2009/10/wtf-actual-play.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31707300.post-1760836993374988000' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/1760836993374988000' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.itemClass' value='pid-664021944'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.displayTime' value='October 06, 2009 4:38 PM'/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31707300.post-5057312884813403596</id><published>2009-10-06T16:57:20.697-04:00</published><updated>2009-10-06T16:57:20.697-04:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment'/><title type='text'>It&amp;#39;s probably worth noting that one of our gro...</title><content type='html'>It&amp;#39;s probably worth noting that one of our group joined the game an hour or two in progress, without even having read the book, and he seemed to catch on fine once we explained the basics of Harmony, Theurgy, and Fatalism... and of course, the underlying conceit of being able to roll them to call BS on anything anyone said ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing in the text that leaps out at me as genuinely muddled (as opposed to a deliberate lacuna) is the Gifts.  As I understand their qualities, Truth is essentially color (if you have the Gift &amp;quot;Master of Warfare&amp;quot; with weak Truth and strong Mechanical support you&amp;#39;ll always win a battle, it&amp;#39;s just that no one will believe you when you tell them, and/or it might be through dumb luck) and Mechanical Support and Valence overlap somewhat confusingly.  The issue Nick and I had was that, from a purely ends-oriented perspective, it seems to me like Valence is the only thing that matters.  If a Gift has poor Truth and/or MS, it colors the narration, but by my reading Valence and Valence alone affects whether or not exercising that gift will resolve any problems.  Using a high-Valence Gift might &amp;quot;fail&amp;quot; in narrative terms, but it will always &amp;quot;succeed&amp;quot; in terms of getting some kind of unambiguously positive result... which is, I presume, why anyone would ever want to use a Gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;#39;d also appreciate printed page numbers, since looking things up in our hardcopies during play was very hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;If they were, they would probably be physically separated into a series of four books, one named &amp;quot;Everyone read&amp;quot; and the others each focused on one of the three types of characters&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mmm... not really!  I had that same thought as I started reading, and the chapter breaks certainly make it look that way, but you honestly should read through the W, T, and F sections no matter what you intend on playing.  The info in each section is incomplete without the others, and if nothing else any player can jump into any attempted use of Harmony, Theurgy, and Fatalism so it&amp;#39;s a good idea to be familiar with what they do.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/1760836993374988000/comments/default/5057312884813403596'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/1760836993374988000/comments/default/5057312884813403596'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2009/10/wtf-actual-play.html?showComment=1254862640697#c5057312884813403596' title=''/><author><name>Joe Iglesias</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/06271218647133689762</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='28' src='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_H_y2qyakj7E/SY-ikQhhOyI/AAAAAAAAAFo/7573bat4CT4/S220-s32/pr.JPG'/></author><thr:in-reply-to href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2009/10/wtf-actual-play.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31707300.post-1760836993374988000' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/1760836993374988000' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.itemClass' value='pid-677223955'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.displayTime' value='October 06, 2009 4:57 PM'/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31707300.post-451239856004454470</id><published>2009-10-06T17:00:38.034-04:00</published><updated>2009-10-06T17:00:38.034-04:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment'/><title type='text'>Oh yeah, I should also mention that we didn&amp;#39;t ...</title><content type='html'>Oh yeah, I should also mention that we didn&amp;#39;t touch on Shadow or Corrupted Insight/Knowledge at ALL, and actually are still a little fuzzy on the concept.

Here&amp;#39;...</title><content type='html'>Sam is having a bit of trouble posting.  Here&amp;#39;s what he wanted to say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;I was a little confused about Insight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is happening in the fiction when I roll insight?  Is my character saying &amp;quot;I want the world to be this way, so I&amp;#39;m using my insight magic to change it?&amp;quot;  In other words, is it a conscious choice on the part of the theurgist character?  This is problematic for me, because it seems like the character KNOWS the world is one way, and uses magic to make it the way he WANTS it to be - this would make all insight corrupt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alternatively, perhaps what happens when one rolls insight is that I, the player, am using Insight to make the world shift to match the beliefs of my character.  The character&amp;#39;s mental state then would be very similar to what happens when one rolls knowledge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Presumably there&amp;#39;s a third option I&amp;#39;m missing?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, I blame myself for that.  Sam was one of the people who had not read the text.  As I understand it, Insight is corrupt when the character uses it to change something in a way they don&amp;#39;t &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; think it should be.  And that&amp;#39;s called by the Weaver.  So, since I was Weaver when the party was lost in the desert, and someone rolled insight+law to make it so no one in the world needed to drink fluids to survive any more, I&amp;#39;m quite sure I should have said something.  Instead I was filled with fear and a desire to signal friendliness with capitulation.  I guess I should have seen saying &amp;quot;Okay, now defend your epistemology&amp;quot; as a type of &amp;quot;Yes and&amp;quot; rather than a type of &amp;quot;No but.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, the three roles get a little book about their deal, so something equivalent for the weaver would be great...&amp;quot;If you are also the Weaver, do all this stuff, remember these things.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;@Joe: I agree that reading one of the books gives you an incomplete picture.  My thought was that would encourage you to defer to the other players as sources of information, to haltingly work together...Although, partial duplication might be good, at least when it comes to information on corruption, which I don&amp;#39;t recall as being located in the W, T, and F books.  It would have helped to say on the &amp;quot;use of stat summary page&amp;quot; something like &amp;quot;You can NEVER override someone and call it harmonious,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;You can NEVER change things into a way that you think makes the world worse,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;You can NEVER tell a lie.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought that my position as Weaver did make the effect of gifts more obvious, but when almost everyone took three or four of them (which surprised me), that was far beyond my ability to track.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as rolls: I noticed that when a player called for a roll, that was one of the few times they could nearly guarantee everyone else at the table to listen to them.  So that&amp;#39;s a beam in our own eyes, I think.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/1760836993374988000/comments/default/8953503413839951585'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/1760836993374988000/comments/default/8953503413839951585'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2009/10/wtf-actual-play.html?showComment=1254863145281#c8953503413839951585' title=''/><author><name>Nick Novitski</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08863651199447917923</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2009/10/wtf-actual-play.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31707300.post-1760836993374988000' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/1760836993374988000' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.itemClass' value='pid-1081303302'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.displayTime' value='October 06, 2009 5:05 PM'/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31707300.post-2722144770083112565</id><published>2009-10-06T17:19:50.912-04:00</published><updated>2009-10-06T17:19:50.912-04:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment'/><title type='text'>&lt;i&gt;So, since I was Weaver when the party was lost ...</title><content type='html'>&lt;i&gt;So, since I was Weaver when the party was lost in the desert, and someone rolled insight+law to make it so no one in the world needed to drink fluids to survive any more, I&amp;#39;m quite sure I should have said something.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hmm... I can go either way on that.  We were pushing the pilgrim&amp;#39;s progress metaphysical journey aspects pretty hard, so it seemed totally appropriate that the noble sacrifice the Wisher&amp;#39;s animal friends made by letting us quench our thirst with their blood would have had such a sweeping metaphysical effect.  Plus that also led to the cool bits later about us all being &amp;quot;vampires&amp;quot; and hence automatically citizens of Raif, and the argument on whether the destruction of &amp;quot;thirst&amp;quot; returned the city&amp;#39;s undead vampires to grace.  I don&amp;#39;t think letting that one ride was a bad call.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;I noticed that when a player called for a roll, that was one of the few times they could nearly guarantee everyone else at the table to listen to them.

They want to honor their family and obey their king, just in a different way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I&amp;#39;m not sure if that carries forward to the modern day: white American society, at least, values rebellious superior individuals enough that it seems there&amp;#39;d be a tragedy of the Super-Commons.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/286090934876739731/comments/default/4436634297140973905'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/286090934876739731/comments/default/4436634297140973905'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2009/10/terminology-superempowered.html?showComment=1256677399906#c4436634297140973905' title=''/><author><name>Nick Novitski</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08863651199447917923</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2009/10/terminology-superempowered.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31707300.post-286090934876739731' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/286090934876739731' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.itemClass' value='pid-1081303302'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.displayTime' value='October 27, 2009 5:03 PM'/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31707300.post-9056059696942978827</id><published>2009-11-04T20:48:31.282-05:00</published><updated>2009-11-04T20:48:31.282-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment'/><title type='text'>I&amp;#39;m sure I don&amp;#39;t know why this particular ...</title><content type='html'>I&amp;#39;m sure I don&amp;#39;t know why this particular post is attractive to spammers.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/4858781384541412065/comments/default/9056059696942978827'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/4858781384541412065/comments/default/9056059696942978827'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2006/10/drowning-and-falling.html?showComment=1257385711282#c9056059696942978827' title=''/><author><name>Nick Novitski</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08863651199447917923</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2006/10/drowning-and-falling.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31707300.post-4858781384541412065' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/4858781384541412065' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.itemClass' value='pid-1081303302'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.displayTime' value='November 04, 2009 8:48 PM'/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31707300.post-4937088421764695727</id><published>2010-05-14T20:29:35.504-04:00</published><updated>2010-05-14T20:29:35.504-04:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment'/><title type='text'>Well, belated birthday wishes.

It said you should keep making characters, using the standard system, until you had one with the speciality they wanted, then let them conduct an interview, and if they didn&amp;#39;t hire them, then resume making characters until you came up with yet another doctor or cook or whatever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However small the emotional investment, it would obviously be a pareto-optimal move to make the lifepath system only able to create &amp;quot;the ones who survived&amp;quot;.  It should not be too controversial to make it &amp;quot;the ones you wanted to play&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I told this to Jim, a friend of mine who was around for Traveller the first time.  This was before I had read any of it, and I just knew the system by reputation.  He told me that he had been part of the Trillion Credit Squadron tournament at an early GenCon, whereby people would design ships and construct a navy with the eponymous budget, and then pair of and each take a few moves in the space combat system before the allotted two hour time limit would run out and someone would have to be declared the winner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He actually got to play against one of the designers.  And he mentioned to this gentleman &amp;quot;You know, I bet if we all made, say, billion credit squadrons, we&amp;#39;d actually get some playing done!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Yeah,&amp;quot; he said reluctantly, &amp;quot;but you couldn&amp;#39;t make a &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; Imperial Squadron with only a billion credits.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think Jim said he didn&amp;#39;t see the full insanity of this until years later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also think Realism as a fully general excuse for a game&amp;#39;s vicissitudes is not entirely unlike Tradition as a general excuse for boarding school violence.

I can see my way to saying yes to that, and do that sometimes already, but I&amp;#39;m not sure yet. For instance, I like reading and playing single-player video games and do that most often &amp;quot;for fun&amp;quot;. I also enjoy talking to people or cooking, and consider those fun, but I don&amp;#39;t DO them as often as I do things I find fun but are generally boring for other people. A perhaps more accurate (though likely needlessly so, since I might be an outlier here) phrasing should be, &amp;quot;what things do you find fun that involve other people?&amp;quot; Given the objective &amp;quot;spend as much time as possible around extroverted people who actively pursue things that are fun for other people to be involved in doing&amp;quot;, then I think the question works perfectly. I just wanted to speak up for the introvert/cat mentality since the focus seemed to be on the extrovert/dog mentality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it&amp;#39;s hard to be cool or interesting when one, say, works many hours (has two jobs, etc.), so it could be called discriminatory to the lower-income strata. Then again, it&amp;#39;s not discriminatory per se, in that criteria is &amp;quot;fun to be around&amp;quot;, not &amp;quot;not poor people&amp;quot;. There&amp;#39;s just a correlation there. People who work a lot are, I&amp;#39;ll go out on a limb, probably not as fun to be around as people who don&amp;#39;t.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/3876640883975182486/comments/default/5352323176579372462'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/3876640883975182486/comments/default/5352323176579372462'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2011/02/get-to-know-people-better-faster.html?showComment=1297807283007#c5352323176579372462' title=''/><author><name>Ben</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07015315349960683809</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2011/02/get-to-know-people-better-faster.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31707300.post-3876640883975182486' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/3876640883975182486' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.itemClass' value='pid-1488967715'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.displayTime' value='February 15, 2011 5:01 PM'/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31707300.post-8350455553162601547</id><published>2011-02-15T17:02:05.693-05:00</published><updated>2011-02-15T17:02:05.693-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment'/><title type='text'>Are those cars!?</title><content type='html'>Are those cars!?</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/7100777337068369760/comments/default/8350455553162601547'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/7100777337068369760/comments/default/8350455553162601547'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2011/02/short-story-in-pictures.html?showComment=1297807325693#c8350455553162601547' title=''/><author><name>Ben</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07015315349960683809</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to href='http://brightinstrument.blogspot.com/2011/02/short-story-in-pictures.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31707300.post-7100777337068369760' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/31707300/posts/default/7100777337068369760' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.itemClass' value='pid-1488967715'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.displayTime' value='February 15, 2011 5:02 PM'/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-31707300.post-8025064861764365356</id><published>2011-02-15T21:05:53.621-05:00</published><updated>2011-02-15T21:05:53.621-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment'/><title type='text'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadillac_Ranch
