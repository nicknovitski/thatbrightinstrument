Full Disclosure: I am (apparently) a veteran of a foreign war. <br /><br />Yesterday my father (as always, only half-jokingly) again suggested that I could make many worse life choices than to join the Navy.&nbsp; But he may have been slightly more than half-joking this time, since he immediately added that I'm one year too old to join Officer Candidacy School.&nbsp; <br /><br />It's just another milestone passed on the long dark highway going nowhere, another opportunity missed, scratched off life's dance card.&nbsp; So what makes it particularly poignant?<br /><br />Formative decisions are much more common than we can see; only a few of them are obvious.&nbsp; Military service is structured and designed to make you into something unusual and impressive.&nbsp; Males all dream, at least briefly, of being badasses, and the three branches (no, not five branches: Marines are Naval personnel/ordinance and the Coast Guard, while badass in their own right, don't count as military to me) are the crystallization of the resources and efforts and expertise of more generations than I can easily imagine (they pass quicker when you're being shot at) in the form of semi-functional badass factories.<br /><br />I don't mean to lionize or deify these people, not least since that would be to simultaneously demonize them, as so many "uncivilized" societies clearly know, as Mark Twain taught me.<br /><br /><object height="344" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/jJsZCpp8hR4&hl=en&fs=1&rel=0&color1=0x006699&color2=0x54abd6"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/jJsZCpp8hR4&hl=en&fs=1&rel=0&color1=0x006699&color2=0x54abd6" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object><br /><br /><object height="344" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/PsoJ-WJZGXM&hl=en&fs=1&rel=0&color1=0x006699&color2=0x54abd6"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/PsoJ-WJZGXM&hl=en&fs=1&rel=0&color1=0x006699&color2=0x54abd6" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object><br /><br />Let's ask it directly:&nbsp; Who prays for soldiers?&nbsp; Who prays for war?&nbsp; Who prays for death to come to one stranger rather than to another? <br /><br />People who want to be distinguished.&nbsp; Those who actually sign up frequently want to risk more than what is typically risked, because the gains seem more attractive to them, because what they have isn't so great compared to the big heap of genetic-material-delivering muscle and hoo-ah the training can turn them into.&nbsp;<br /><br />That plus the slightly-less-long-term concerns of feeding and sheltering and deciding become things you no longer need to worry your pretty little head about.<br /><br />That plus, for some of them, they think that some people need to die, and that their own lives are well spent being risked on that outcome.<br /><br />There's any number of ways in which you can contribute to the future of your country.&nbsp; There's any number of people who deserve thanks for what they did, just because it ensured the life we currently live rather than some other less fortunate one.&nbsp; But veterans of foreign wars are <br /><br />So there are the two big reasons to serve as I see it, as I've seen it and heard it from others:&nbsp; You become someone else, which can be a good deal if you aren't so fond of your current someone, and you don't have to sweat the small stuff, the vagaries and what-comes-nexts that don't <br />-Nick
