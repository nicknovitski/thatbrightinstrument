<p>I found this somewhere.  It's old, but it still obtends.<br /></p><p style="text-align: center;"><font face="arial,sans-serif">*  *  *  *  *<br /></font></p><p><font face="arial,sans-serif"> Publishing is worth far, far less than it used to be.</font></p><p><font face="arial,sans-serif">There is a backlash lashing back at the most recent of these devaluings.  It is as mild and dry and swollen with hidden scorn as you would expect from the posse of writers and teachers and librarians and literature critics who wield it.  I have nothing but respect and disagreement for them.<br /></font></p><p><font face="arial,sans-serif">You've heard the same song before with different lyrics: Books are "threatened," "under attack" or even "siege."  Sitting in front of a screen just "isn't the same" as "curling up before the fire."  They sexualize their charges in order to defend them.  "Light the candles, pour some scented oils and sink into the warm bath with your favorite relaxing, well-worn paperback," they coo, "Feel the weight of it, the sharp-edged softness of the pages, the leprous flaking of the cover.  It's your friend, it's your family, it's your lover!  How could anyone want to hurt it?"<br /></font></p><p><font face="arial,sans-serif">Books are not threatened by the forces of novelty.  Books are threatened today by the same groups that have been doing it this whole time:<br /></font></p><p><font face="arial,sans-serif"><br /></font></p><p><font face="arial,sans-serif">doesn't the No one wants to attack books.  The problem is that thetheir narrow The narrow.  People far more intelligent than me have pointed out that the procession from the plasticine present of written content to its gaseous future is logical not from looking at developments of the last 5 years, but of the last 500.  Long ago, men wrote books by hand.  Then, other men might, if they knew how to read and if they thought it worth their time (and time was worth more before the degree of industrialization of food production that we first-worlders enjoy today), write someone else's book again.  Then, changeable type meant that you could make scads and scads of copies just about anything.  The golden ages of Greece and Baghdad were as deserts compared to the post-Gutenberg era.  More copies of works meant that more works survived fires both accidental and purposeful, as well as more people who had read those works, having thoughts of their own concerning them, having access to a method of disseminating those thoughts widely and rapidly.  More books meant more value in the skills of reading and writing, meaning more literacy, meaning still more books.<br /></font></p><p><font face="arial,sans-serif">    Literacy rates self-regulate at their current levels, with America at a less-than-Japan, more-than-Somalia grade.  Barring genuine public schooling reform, reading has reached a maximum point of saturation.  But writing has not.  The Internet, the quality of computers to be more useful the more other computers they can communicate with, continues Gutenberg's task, making more works available to more people.  The good people at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenberg</a> take this task deadly serious.  Most of them, however, know that turning text into txt is only the first step.  It is the following step that seems the doozy to the tradition-valuing publisher, reader and writer, that seems a horror story with some shiny-eyed Fritz Lang social planners as the antagonists.  Google, to take an example dear to my heart, does not wish to scan the world's information, but to index it.  When I start to ponder that, images of hyperdimensional virtual <i>spines</i> rise that would have made Leibniz proud to know how right he was, but they just make me breath fast and give strange sighing, mewling noises.<br /></font></p><p><font face="arial,sans-serif">    The Internet is not entirely unlike Plato's old bugaboo: The world of Forms.  Someone might claim that this page does exist somewhere, in a pattern of particles not unlike anything else.  They would say that I wrote it, it then traveled to that home, a server stack in Palo Alto or Atlanta or Baltimore, and that it can subsequently travel to the terminal of anyone who accesses it through the identifier commonly called a page.  But this traveling is, in some sense, a false idea.  Signals travel between these things, but an object, like a computer, cannot contain a thought.  Signals induce thoughts, but can't equate to them.  Only people (using the term loosely) have thoughts.  The Internet is not unlike me looking through binoculars at something I wouldn't ordinarily see, like, say, a buzzard soaring over a distant highway or parking lot.  When I see him, that buzzard is exactly as present as if he were sitting next to me or, more poetically, as if I was flying next to him.  And if I took a picture through a telephoto lens of that view of the buzzard that gave me that moment of closeness, I could return to that thermal in that cobalt sky at any time in future.  And if I gave a copy of that picture to someone else, they would join me in that perfect and unchanging sky, with that perfect and unchanging bald scavenger, until an infinite number of people come to coincide in that single spaceless space for all of timeless time.  The sky is not in the picture, or the binoculars, or the photons whose sussurating impacts convince me of it's existence.  The sky <i>is</i>, both up there and, in some way, in me and anyone else thinking about it.  Regarding it, let's say.</font></p><p><font face="arial,sans-serif">    Plato thought that ideas didn't come from people, that there were a limited number of them, and that they were things or places that we saw or went when we regarded them.  His obvious mistake, to most modern thinkers, is to assume their absolute permanence.  He wanted them to be perfect, you see.  Nowadays, perfection is usually seen as a limit condition.  The greater the rate at which something improves, the better it is.  Software A and B are identical in feature set, usability and price.  Software A will be updated three times at intervals of two months before its developers are pulled for more profitable ventures.  Software B will be updated incrementally, once a week, forever.  Software B is more perfect than software A.  Our modern perfection adjusts.  Plato's forms are ridiculous, in that light.  We all know that sometimes, people have had ideas that no one else ever did, and that other people have made those ideas better.  Bell made a phone and Edison made it usable.  Things have continuously and gradually improved.  What could be wrong with that.<br /></font></p><p><font face="arial,sans-serif">    Life arose from a soup.  Molecules fizzed around.  Some of them found they fit with others, and more complex molecules grew.  Eventually, systems came to be, ideas before anyone could have ideas as we understand it, the thoughts and dreams of proteins and virii and, a ridiculously long time later, bacteria.  Fish, reptiles, mammals, humans, iron, the cotton gin, the Internet.  The next step I referred to is something like rendering the blocky, gamey substance of the sum of human knowledge, dicing and misting it, putting it in suspension of something suitably fluid.  Making a soup.  This being done, different groups will keep trying different plans and programs in different pools and ponds and oceans and pots of this soup until something happens.  System.  Life, we call it when it's made of proteins.<br /></font></p><p><font face="arial,sans-serif">    Is continuous and gradual improvement sounding scary yet?</font></p><p><font face="arial,sans-serif">    The point is, publishing is so easy now that it is worth next to nothing, and it will gradually be worth less and less as it becomes universal.  People whose self-importance is defined by being published will complain and fight for fear of being made irrelevant.  People like me, on the other hand, will eventually realize that they aren't being self important just because they happened to scrawl something on the Internet, that infinitely wide restroom wall.  I do not particularly fear judgement from people I can see, and the distant invisible cannot be any more frightening.  Swallowing my fear of hubris, then, is all I need to do before everything I think becomes fair game for mass consumption.<br /></font></p><p><font face="arial,sans-serif">*: The Only Real Argument, or the real reason that people disagree with one another, all other claimed reasons (statistics, logic, quotation of religious of areligious texts) being merely summoned to reinforce a feeling of rightness in the arguer or the target of argument.  In brief, it amounts to something like "I would have it seem this way to me."</font></p><br /><br />-Nick
