Someone is writing a letter. &nbsp;No, it's vaguer than that. &nbsp;Some kind of text, in some kind of medium, conveyed to me by the narrator. &nbsp;He's invented something, and he's writing a...message, that he hopes will explain it, and his actions.<br /><br />As he addresses his unknown audience to come, the camera occasionally shows him (Am I him? &nbsp;No, I am the camera) in his home, or laboratory (always alone, whether working, eating, or just gazing at a barren, nearly lunar landscape through thick bay windows), but most of the shots don't show anyone. &nbsp;They're heavily filtered, grainy and yellowed, and depict seemingly random scenes (an empty school playground, an oak tree in a field seen from a passing car, a city from): he's thinking about his past, his life up to this point.<br /><br />He's not talking about the past, though. &nbsp;He doesn't bother explaining the function of the machine, but he knows that it will be found - he's addressing the finders - and he's confident it can be easily duplicated. &nbsp;It's energy-intensive, but considering the effects...<br /><br />At this point, he pauses to look meaningfully at a closet-sized booth that stands open in the center of his lab space. &nbsp;This is the focus of the power of the machinery - mostly computational - which twists and burrows through the surrounding cold and rocky ground (ah, it's an asteroid, the ultimate in privacy, his people have already started flitting around their solar system). &nbsp;When the machine is activated, the space&nbsp;inside that container is exchanged with an equivalent space in a sufficiently described universe.<br /><br />Getting that description was the trick. &nbsp;Properly encoding the test destination string took years, and accurately storing it was an exercise in multiple redundancy, immense files duplicated and re-versioned across a dozen<br /><br />He could destroy it, of course. &nbsp;Destroy it, and deny the true happiness of everyone in his<br /><br />-Nick
