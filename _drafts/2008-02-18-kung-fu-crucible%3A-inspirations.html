Part of the game is making a large fictional world as a group, that your later stories will explore, and there's a specific order of operations that the procedure follows.  The first step is always to list the new world's inspirations: the media, whether movies, books, shows, music or games, which you want the new world to be able to claim as an influence.<br /><br />It struck me as a good idea for reasons I can't fully explain.
