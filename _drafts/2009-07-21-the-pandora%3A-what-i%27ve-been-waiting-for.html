Everyone has their Era. &nbsp;Mine is the Super Nintendo.<br /><br />The Something Awful Forums are kings<br /><br />If I had a nickel for every time I considered one of Nintendo's portable gaming consoles and said "What I really want is something that can fit in my pocket, and play Super Nintendo games," then I would have an indeterminate amount of money.<br /><br /><br />So. &nbsp;It clamshells open to reveal an 800x640 widescreen <i>touchscreen</i>&nbsp;LCD. &nbsp;There are four buttons on the right, a directional pad on the left, two analog buttons in the middle, along with "Select" and "Start" and "Home,"<br /><br />It can connect with basically any USB device. &nbsp;Mice, gamepads, thumb-drives, cellphones, GPS units. &nbsp;It can direct output along an S-Video cable to a monitor or television. &nbsp;It has a headphone/speaker jack.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.pandorawiki.org/Pandora">http://www.pandorawiki.org/Pandora</a><br /><br />-Nick
