I think I have the right of this, but it wasn't made perfectly clear in the book, and I think it should be emphasized.<br /><br />When making an opposed test, you compare the actor's statistic with the target's statistic, and add a number of difficulty dice to the test based on that comparison. &nbsp;That is, if the target stat is less than one-half the acting stat, add zero dice, between one-half and equal, add one die, and so on.<br /><br />Basic attacks are opposed tests against the target's defense. &nbsp;So you'd think that this would mean higher defense just adds more difficulty dice. &nbsp;And I believe that's so. &nbsp;However, the rulebook section on attacks just says that you should add one <i>misfortune</i> die for every single point of defense.<br /><br />I strongly suspect that both of these things act in conjunction, but I think it would be great to have a single sentence say "This is in addition to the difficulty dice added from comparing your strength or agility to the target's defense." &nbsp;And maybe even "Hitting someone who doesn't want to be hit isn't just difficult: it's dangerous!"<br /><br />The other thing is funnier. &nbsp;I ended up wasting<br /><br />a lot of time trying Second: I ended up wasting a lot of time looking for the effects of injury. That is, in the section on damage, healing and impairment, there's a brief talk about what the different levels of wounds "mean," but I was surprised to see no mechanical effect for different levels of "hp loss." That is, if you have taken more than half your max in wounds, you are "severely injured," but that in itself doesn't, say, add challenge dice to actions, or anything like that.<br /><br />It's possible that I just failed at reading comprehension, but I couldn't find anything on the subject in any of the books. But then it occurred to me: that's probably what critical wounds and conditions are for. If you manage to lose a fair number of hit points without taking any critical hits or getting your stress or exhaustion very high, then there's nothing wrong with you a little rest won't cure, so in what way would you be impaired? And anyway, who wants to count cards and calculate percentages and add problem dice as appropriate for every roll?!<br /><br />Well, some people, but that's what optional rules will be for. If I could think of an easy way of doing it, I'd be coming up with one already.<br /><br />Anyway, I think that I won't be the only one in the world who will look for something that isn't there, and I think a note in that section on the fact that there are no inherent effects of having wounds beyond eventually getting ko'd would help. But maybe that would be pulling the veil back too far. :)
