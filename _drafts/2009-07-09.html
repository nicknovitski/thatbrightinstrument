Panic attack last night, first and worst for quite a while now, exploding out of bed, leaping/sprinting/stomping from wall to wall in the corridor, living room, balcony, hurling tennis-player's grunts and punching anything within reach.<br /><br />The thought of Death makes me furious, motivates me to action, to violence, like absolutely nothing else. <br /><br /><br />-Nick
