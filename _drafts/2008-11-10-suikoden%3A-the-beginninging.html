There are three broadly recognized classics resting at the pinnacle of Asian literature: <i>The Journey West</i>, <i>The Romance of the Three Kingdoms</i>, and <i>The Outlaws of the Water Margin</i>.<br /><br /><i>The Journey West</i> is about a monkey whom Buddha traps under a rock for not knowing sufficient restraint, and who later protects a priest and their friends on a pilgrimage to India.&nbsp; It was the loose inspiration for <i>Dragon Ball</i>, an IP with generational appeal in males aged 14-24.&nbsp; <i>Dragon Ball </i>has been a very, very long-running comic with matching television show, plus about a dozen movies, plus (most saliently) dozens and dozens of video games over the years.<br /><br /><i>The Romance of the Three Kingdoms</i> is about the lengthy conflict of the "Warring States" period of Chinese history (or rather, the history of the geographic region which is today mostly contained within the recognized sovereign territory of the People's Republic of China).&nbsp; I have lost count of the number of creative works I know that are based on the events of the novel, but we can safely stick with videogames:&nbsp; There's the <i>Romance of the Three Kingdoms</i> series, games of strategy and tactics, where you choose a state and starting character, then try to trick, recruit and expand your way to dominance, and there's <i>Dynasty Warriors</i>, where you choose a character and chop your way through teeming battlefields...to dominance.&nbsp; Both franchises have had a gazillion sequels.<br /><br /><i>The Outlaws of the Water Margin</i> (or <i>of the Marsh</i> or <i>of Mt. Liang</i> or <i>of Liangshan Marsh</i> or even just <i>All Men Are Brothers</i>) is about 108 demons who are accidentally released from a demon-box and incarnate as 108 dudes who have assorted amusing adventures but eventually unite into a single band of whup-assery.&nbsp; Koei made the first video game to ever be based on the story, a strategic title released in America as <i>Bandit Kings of Ancient China</i>.<br /><br />The second was a "JRPG" called <i>Gensou Suikoden</i>.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f9/Suikoden_packaging01.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="420" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f9/Suikoden_packaging01.jpg" width="411" /></a></div><br />Okay, if you haven't noticed it yet, that little "PAL" in the upper left corner means this is the box art for the European release, based heavily on the original Japanese box.&nbsp; So yes, they got to see a watercolor crammed with awesome folks all looking out and getting ready to burst on to the world scene, including that one kid looking <b>right at you</b> with eyes beyond his apparent years and a half-completed gesture that says "On my command, by which I mean hitting the punk holding the box upside the head so hard they'll be be pulling his teeth out of the ceiling, unleash hell, by which I mean all 108 of you look awesome <b>as hard as you can</b>."<br /><br />We did not see that.&nbsp; This was still when the geniuses in marketing were convinced that "Americans" preferred their art to be less "arty" and more "shitty."&nbsp; Witness Megaman, Street Fighter, Strider, and Suikoden.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.megghy.com/immagini/Psx/FICHE%20S/COVERS/Suikoden_US.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="420" src="http://www.megghy.com/immagini/Psx/FICHE%20S/COVERS/Suikoden_US.jpg" width="420" /></a></div><br />I have no goddamn idea what is going on in this picture.&nbsp; None of those people are in the game anywhere.&nbsp; In fact, the only things depicted here which are in the game are:<br /><ol><li>A lake.</li><li>A totally sweet castle in the middle of the lake.</li></ol>(Protip!&nbsp; "Suikoden" is the transliteration of the way that Japanese folks pronounce the characters which are frequently translated as "Water Margin.")<br /><br />So unfortunately<br /><br /><object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/u8N9_i1HgBg&hl=en&fs=1&rel=0&color1=0x006699&color2=0x54abd6"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/u8N9_i1HgBg&hl=en&fs=1&rel=0&color1=0x006699&color2=0x54abd6" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object><br /><br />-Nick
