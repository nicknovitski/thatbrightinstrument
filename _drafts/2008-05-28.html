News about Wave has reminded me of several ideas I had a while back (but, I freely admit, that I had no way of implementing, and it weren't nearly as generally cool as Wave, so please don't think I'm trying to claim any kind of injury here).<br /><br />It's also made me very sad that I wasn't able to go to Google I/O this year. &nbsp;Here's the keynote that introduced it. &nbsp;Imagine my jaw dropping repeatedly as it progresses.<br /><br /><object height="360" width="580"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/v_UyVmITiYQ&hl=en&fs=1&rel=0&color1=0x006699&color2=0x54abd6&border=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/v_UyVmITiYQ&hl=en&fs=1&rel=0&color1=0x006699&color2=0x54abd6&border=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="580" height="360"></embed></object><br /><br />Perhaps you'll complain it's too long. &nbsp;You're welcome to come back to the video when you have time to watch it. &nbsp;Personally, I think that it's worth it. &nbsp;Feel free to not pay attention during the brief technical delays.<br /><br />So like I was saying, these ideas...<br /><br />I post on this blog very sporadically. &nbsp;I find it rare that I summon the energy to put together a post that I'm confident I can show to the world without concern. &nbsp;I try to be careful and thorough and useful and unembarrasing (or at least, inoffensive). &nbsp;In fact, I try to only publicly post things that I could accept being read by everyone in the entire world.<br /><br />This is a fairly high barrier, so my infrequency should be no surprise. &nbsp;But contrast this with the fact that, thanks to Reader, I'm able to follow a great many blogs and websites, which regularly allows me to make some small contribution to the discussions started by others. &nbsp;Many of the bloggers whom I follow, out of interest in their opinions and activities also follow other folks' blogs, and comment on them, and some of them also participate in forums, but I'm only ever aware of the one<br /><br />used to have.a unity of play-by-post, actual play, and wiki-things and real-time stuff<br /><br /><br /><br />-Nick
