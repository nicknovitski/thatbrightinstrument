Hello. &nbsp;You don't know me, and very little about me should matter to you, except that I live in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ones_Who_Walk_Away_from_Omelas">Omelas</a>.<br /><br />You might have heard of us. &nbsp;I hope you have, because explaining it to the unfamiliar usually involves a lot of sceptical snorts and<br /><br />suffice it to say that the city is constructed such that everything is exceptionally well-managed, prosperous and at peace, so long as in one lightless room one unfortunate child is kept sick, starved, and devoid of pleasant contact.<br /><br />oh, and also, such that everyone is aware of the ineluctable causal link between the sequestering and the prospering. &nbsp;And, of course, that everyone is aware of<br /><br />I recall a paper in a scientific journal concerning just how much better life was here than elsewhere. &nbsp;it had been buried further in.<br /><br />Oh, and some twinge of civic pride prompts me to tell you that it rhymes with "lace," not "lass." &nbsp;So sorry, very common and understandable mistake. &nbsp;Most people don't know where the city is, of course, so they are to be quite forgiven for thinking that English is spoken there.<br /><br />Which it is, of course, by those who learn it. &nbsp;My first degree was actually in English Literature, though I specialized in<br /><br />My reference to scientific journals has already betrayed me as a pedant.<br /><br />It's as<br /><br />I realized that I would eventually come to not think about it. <br /><br />If I was going to have to set down the problem eventually, how could I<br /><br />So of course, I endeavored to free the unfortunate. &nbsp;And yes, he did have a name, and a past and a purpose, but again, his significance to you is confined to his role in this story. &nbsp;Try as I might, I don't feel as if I can ever bridge the gap between this accurate language required of ethical balancing-acts and the simple reality of another person's touch. &nbsp;It's like reaching for your own hand in the mirror: you feel a smooth and horribly perfect barrier<br /><br />You'd be surprised at how easy it was. &nbsp;Though in this I assume you aren't Omelassian, in which case you would say "Well we never thought anyone would <i>do</i>&nbsp;something about it!" &nbsp;To which your response might be to laugh, because you will think of it in all kinds of improper analogies. &nbsp;You might imagine - it's the one I've heard the most - a fantastic power plant which uses some sort of easy-to-transport fuel, and which produces incredible results<br /><br />Well, there never were any clear numbers, but judging from birth and citizenship records, it's safe to say far more people stayed, became reconciled to the situation, than ever left the city. &nbsp;And by definition, nearly 100% of the<br /><br />I dub it Ethical Inertia: it is less demanding to tolerate suffering than to inflict it.<br /><br />-Nick
