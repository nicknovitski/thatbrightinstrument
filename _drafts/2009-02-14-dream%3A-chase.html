Large parking lot, row of warehouses maybe?&nbsp; something bad has happened, and people are hemming and hawing over it.&nbsp; far towards the entrance/exit of the parking lot, walking away, i point out a kid in a parka.&nbsp; The parka's changing colors.&nbsp; It's trying to blend in to the surroundings.&nbsp; I notify the others and begin walking slowly towards the entrance/exit, gingerly stepping around the ice on the ground.&nbsp; the kid gets on a motorcycle.&nbsp; I begin running, hop on one of mine, but in the time it takes me to start it, he's roared past and around a corner.&nbsp; I follow, and see he (she?) has disappeared into<br /><br />I'm outside and behind myself now.&nbsp;<br /><br />"Shit.&nbsp; She ditched.&nbsp; I'm following!"&nbsp; Leaping into the river.<br />-Nick
