Why steal?<br /><br />Everyone should know the answer to this, but I'll say it anyway: if it matters more to you that you get something, than that whatever consequences would follow from the theft be avoided, whether immediate (the person you steal from loses access to the thing stolen) or complex (you are known as a thief, and your job possibilities shrink), then you should try to steal it.<br /><br />You should think carefully before you make this assessment, because the lure of acquiring things can convince you to rate the consequences as nothing! &nbsp;I remember in <i>Les Miserables </i>(okay, in the trailer for the '98 film), Liam Neeson tells the Bishop, "I found that all that stood between me and not being hungry anymore was a pane of glass, so I broke it and ate my fill."<br /><br />He is then forced to break rocks for ten years, and he does not starve, but that was more by luck than anything. &nbsp;The only consequence he saw was the effort to break the glass! &nbsp;There were, in fact, many more!<br /><br />But bread is a pretty serious thing. &nbsp;When you don't have enough food to live, and you steal food from someone who does, but leave enough such that neither of you starve, most people will say "Well, death is worse than theft, so if there actually was no other option, then I guess it was the right thing."<br /><br />These people have never weighed options in their lives. &nbsp; There's no such thing as "no other option," there's only differences, sometimes large ones, in how viable options are.<br /><br />But that's a digression. <br /><br />Actually, let me spin a completely hypothetical scenario: what if there was could not only steal something
