<div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">As I'm fond of saying, Confucius once said that you could carry your parents on your back for a thousand years and still not pay them back for what they've done for you.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br />On the other hand, once I said (and it was only once and I was only playing devil's advocate it's the opposite of my genuine opinion I<span style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp;swear</span>) to a teacher that maybe they should, while doing their job, bear in mind the link between their salary and the tuition the students' parents pay.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br />This teacher, with good reason, disagreed&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">vociferously</span>.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br />In both cases, parents provide the material cause for the person's livelihood: the figurative pound of flesh for the teacher and the less-figurative for the child. &nbsp;You can see how, in both cases, one might argue that something of equivalent value to that livelihood is needed to balance things out. &nbsp;So that's why Confucius says that no finite amount of labor can match the value of being brought from non-existence to existence, the infinite jump from 0 to 1.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br />The behavior that should purportedly follow awareness of this&nbsp;immeasurable&nbsp;debt is what's called "Filial Piety." &nbsp;A virtue that&nbsp;promulgates social stability, but that's not the only reason I dislike it. &nbsp;The problem is, as the teacher understands, that&nbsp;</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br />-Nick</div>
