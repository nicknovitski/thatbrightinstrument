Perhaps it was the lateness of the hour, or having begun to read Burton's travelogue, but he's become an unrepentant reaver of men for the sake of making the faithful live the way his clever-but-ignorant ways think they should. This passage struck me the most forcefully:<br /><br /><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=BeUTAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=inauthor%3A%22%20Richard%20Francis%20Burton%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=1&amp;pg=PA2&amp;ci=156%2C526%2C712%2C245&amp;source=bookclip"><img src="http://books.google.com/books?id=BeUTAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA2&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=3&amp;hl=en&amp;sig=ACfU3U39RJxlM1ilvrufydDwGot7B_r33A&amp;ci=156%2C526%2C712%2C245&amp;edge=0" /></a><br /><br />Yes, much like that.<br /><br />I actually lost my character sheet, but I'm satisfied with the way I was able to reconstruct it. &nbsp;In the interest of not losing it any more:<br /><br />Stats:<br /><br /><ul><li>Acuity: 2d6</li><li>Body: 4d6</li><li>Heart: 4d6</li><li>Will: 5d6</li></ul><br />Traits:<br /><br /><ul><li>"You're gonna shut up and listen," 1d10</li><li>I made good, now I'm a Dog, 1d6</li><li>Wasted time in the woods as a boy, 1d6</li><li>Doing it myself, 1d10</li><li>I brought a man to tears with a hug, 1d4</li><li>I can sin for the faith, 4d6</li></ul><div>Relationships:<br /></div><div><ul><li>Murder, 1d8</li><li>Unspent, 5d6 128</li></ul></div><br />Belongings:<br /><br /><ul><li>Coat: woven with beads in harvest colors and patterns, stained in one spot with the blood of one Professor Drinker, a bad man, 2d6</li><li>Fine Knife, 2d6</li><li>(No Guns)</li></ul><br /><br />-Nick
