If you are walking with other animals, be sure that you keep a close eye<br /><br />Abused dogs sometimes are not as afraid of other dogs as they are of people, so they may be able to play with dogs in ways that they cannot play with you.  Running, touching, even play-fighting may perfectly comfortable to them.  Keep an eye on their body language: if their tail is wagging, they are having a good time.<br /><br />You may feel a pang go through you at these moments, wishing you could be as much of a source of comfort.  People can help dogs so much<br /><br />If you happen to be walking with a horse, be very careful not to let your dog get too close to it. &nbsp;Horses can spook and kick easily from things walking beneath them or in their blind spots, but abused dogs can see them not as dangerous bigger animals, but comforting hiding places. &nbsp;Even if your dog very much wants to hide under the horse, and is terrified at you pulling hard on the leash and giving warning cries, you must harden your heart and think of his safety..
