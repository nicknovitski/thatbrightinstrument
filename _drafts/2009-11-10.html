<div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /><br /><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">A post on&nbsp;<a href="http://eis-blog.ucsc.edu/">Expressive Intelligence Studio</a>&nbsp;(formerly the hipper-named Grand Text Auto, but renown changes the best of us) got me thinking.<br /></div></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">At my college, we all attended classes in Ancient Greek. &nbsp;I was lucky enough to be in the class taught by someone who had Ancient Greek as a specialty. &nbsp;Actually, to all I found on the subject, he was one of the foremost experts on the subject in the world. &nbsp;At the very least, were he not teaching a variety of courses at our bizarro-school, he would (in fact, he now is) instead be making a living purely from knowing what he was purporting to teach us. &nbsp;He may have been the only teacher at the school of which this could truthfully be said, which may have been why his classes were so different from everyone else's.<br /></div></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">He wasn't a fan of homework, and he detested testing. &nbsp;He encouraged us to study and remember as much grammar as we wanted, and felt interested in, but he never told us to, say, memorize a list of vocabulary words for a quiz the next day. &nbsp;In fact, he strenuously objected to the very idea. &nbsp;"To know Greek," he used to say, "is to know how to use a lexicon."<br /></div></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">A lexicon is something like a dictionary, but the ways in which it differs are more important than the similarities. &nbsp;Ancient Greek is a perfectly dead language, which means that the number of original texts written in it is necessarily finite and, as it happens, surprisingly small. &nbsp;Scholars have been looking for and poring over all the works that they could find, but except for a technologically-assisted case a few years ago, there have been no new pieces found for many centuries. &nbsp;So, a lexicon is an index to all the extant words: in its least-abridged form, it is a list of every word that we know was used in every work that we've found, and a list of every line where they were used.<br /></div></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">Ancient Greek, being dead, is never a language you'll be required to speak off the top of your head (although if you're going back in time and need someone who might be fluent, this teacher would have been just the guy), so you're never going to have to know&nbsp;<b>right now</b>&nbsp;what some arbitrary bit of it means, much less how to say something back.<br /></div></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">So he taught us the current best-guess of how the letters were pronounced, and speed-walked us through the grammar (encouraging us to buy a convenient crib-book for it), and discussed obscure points of meaning and psychology whenever we asked him about them, but mostly rushed us to the point in the lesson plan where we could painfully begin guessing at the meaning of actual sections of actual texts written by actual greek people. &nbsp;And once we had reached that point, it was smooth sailing: that's all we did, save for the mandated two essays a semester, and they could be about anything we wanted.<br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">Because, to him, it was perfectly clear that gaining an appreciation of the subtleties of the original texts was the only purpose a Greek class could possibly have.<br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">So that's why the article&nbsp;suddenly led me to a&nbsp;completely ridiculous idea: test-driven education.<br /></div></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">Test-driven development (TDD) is a way of making software that starts with writing stand-alongside software that says what your goals are, and automatically checks if they've been achieved: the "tests." &nbsp;It's far from standard in dev circles, but has many standard-bearers there. &nbsp;The claim is that it makes rapid, stable incremental development more obviously achievable. &nbsp;When you're done, you know you're done, and when you're not done, you know what you still have to do, and whenever you change anything, you know if you've accidentally effd<br /></div></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">One of the consequences of this approach is that you'll find out whether you can actually specify, with mathematical certainty, what constitutes "done." &nbsp;If not, then you arguably don't actually know what you're trying to accomplish.<br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /></div></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">So when people say, "That's crazy, there are some things you can't test." &nbsp;I would say, if you can't test them, then you shouldn't be charging for them.<br /></div></div><br /></div>
