I recently played Remember Tomorrow, a new game by Gregor Hutton, he of 3:16 fame.<br /><br />(3:16 is not a game that I have played, but I could, and I appreciate the structure of its design and its place in the fiction-plane defined by Starship Troopers, Warhammer 40,000, and Apocalypse Now. That's all academic, of course, but I've also heard people play it, and they all seemed to be having at least some fun.)<br /><br />Before I go any further, I feel I should qualify "played." In my opinion, the very first part of any game review should be to say exactly how long or how many times the reviewer has played the game. In the case of RPGs, where many people buy products just to signal their tastes and affiliations, without any serious expectation of using them in an actual game with actual people, the assumption is that a "review" will just give an impression based on reading it.<br /><br />This is a bit like reviewing a book by looking at the jacket, or maybe reviewing a movie by reading the screenplay. It's a bit like those things because it's a fundamentally incomplete experience, but it's not like those things in that it's quite common. I wouldn't mind it so much, so long as you could filter reviews based on whether people had played the game at all, and for how long.<br /><br />So I did play this game, but not for very long. Not even for one full session. I think that's very important to admit, because though I was left with a positive impression, I had several very specific things I'd want to see changed. It's strange to have such pronounced and focused opinions without actually trying the damn thing out, but that may have been a consequence of presentation: the copy I had was assembled by one of my co-players, saddle-stapled pages with gaps and errors in the printing. A real throw-back. It looked like an ashcan, and then when I played it, I saw it as an ashcan.<br /><br />(Funny, he and I used the word "ashcan," and the third person playing didn't know what that meant. So I'll say, it means a printing of an incomplete game you release for free or very cheap, to get playtesting, build excitement, possibly fund a print run.)<br /><br />And ashcans demand specific feedback.<br /><br />Remember Tomorrow has a structure that reminded me of shock: meets Universalis. Everyone takes turns establishing scenes. In their first scene of the first session, each player introduces a character that no one else can control, called the "held character." Characters all have a goal, a thing they really, really want to accomplish. In their second scene, they each introduce an organization, preferably one that hates all the characters. All organizations want to increase their power, represented by their single stat, influence. (subtle, I know)<br /><br />After that, things go into a structured free-for-all. On your turn, you can either introduce yet another character (not a held one, so anyone can use or play as them) or group, you can have your held character make a deal with a group - which makes them more influential and gives your character the chance to improve their position (though not work towards their goal), or you can send a group or other character to fuck up another player's held character.<br /><br />Put it this way: you<br /><br />I should say that Remember Tomorrow has a rule for when you're supposed to stop playing; an episode ends when three entities (individuals or groups) have exited the fiction, whether by getting what they want most (in the case of individuals), moving up to a bigger playing field (groups only), or getting killed (anyone).<br /><br />We didn't reach that point. In fact, we didn't have any exits. I got the impression that it could go on for a pretty shockingly long session. And I wasn't because of any slowness on our part<br /><br />The goal is to emulate an ensemble cast drama, but how many of those have three recurring characters either bite it or hit it big every episode?<br /><br />What might help is making non-held characters more fragile. They can fight with<br /><br />Hypothetically, people could just keep introducing new characters every turn.<br /><br />I was intrigued by the<br /><br />Order of operations problem: it's a very big difference between declaring what your goal is before framing the scene, or after<br /><br />Gear is my least favorite part of it.<br /><br />No fictional results depending on rolls! I'd say that if you fail at each, there's some limitation on your narration. So if you fail ready, something unexpected happens and things go worse than you thought, and if you fail willing, you are given an opportunity that you don't take, and if you fail able...okay, not sure there.
