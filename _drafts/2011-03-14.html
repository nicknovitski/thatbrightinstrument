Perhaps appropriately, the Computer History Museum's flagship exhibit, <i>Revolution: The First 2000 Years of Computing</i>, is by far the most informationally dense exhibit I have ever been exposed to, bar none. &nbsp;On my first day, I was able to reach electricity. &nbsp;On my second day, I was able to complete Integrated Circuits.<br /><br />Computing, like any modern utility, now has is dense<br /><br />Another absolute treasure is the wealth of commercial literature reproduced. <br /><br />Securing the rights must have been a nightmare. &nbsp;There's a video that plays classic videogame advertisements, including the classic Atari Centipede! one, and also including...exactly one other that I don't remember. &nbsp;So not very many, is what I'm saying.<br /><br />If you're anything like me (god help you), you'll flip your shit for the Charlie Chaplin ads<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />There was a guy who had been around the block. And he wasn’t very old, so he decided to write a biography of his life. <br /><br />Well, he started to lie in his biography. He made up some stories. But mostly little stories that were inconsequential. Filler. Like he had a story about a painting he’d done of a red background with elephant legs in front. <br /><br />But he hadn’t ever painted anything of the sort. He further embellished the story by talking about a pricey auction he’d snuck into. An auction in New York City where he’d he overheard his painting go to sale for twenty grand. But that wasn’t the point of the story. The point was that he could fold his body to fit under a lid on a banquet tray. People would raise the lid and they wouldn’t even notice him bracing himself inside. He didn’t even mention the price his painting sold at. <br /><br />Anyway, he really started to like that story (and others like it), to the point where he started to ignore his friends and family, instead preferring to watch what his lie self did after the auction. In his head. <br /><br />So, then, one day he was shopping and he found a pair of shoes that had stripey laces. And he grabbed the shoes and went to the store counter, forcing them in the cashier’s face, yelling, “Look! Look at these! Look! These are the shoes my lie self would wear!”
