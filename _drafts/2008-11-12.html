A friend asked me a while back<br /><blockquote>What do you think is the best form of government?</blockquote>and I thought my response could be an open letter.<br /><br />Imagine if you instead asked me, "What do you think is the best form of life?"&nbsp; My answer would be that the objective judgment is its success at maintaining a continuous line of inheritance, and that it doesn't matter what I think: what lives, lives.&nbsp; But, since that's a non-answer, I'd try to give an aesthetic judgment, taking my preferences as unexamined and settling on an animal or class of animals that is, on the whole, most pleasing for me to regard.&nbsp; I suspect the correct answer would be "dogs."<br /><br />So, in much the same way, the best government is the one that gives rise to the most governments.&nbsp; In the analogy, the history of a given country would be made of successive, slightly different generations, as each system gave rise to an altered form of itself (though the lines between generations would be hard to draw: changing administrations?&nbsp; major laws passed?).&nbsp; For example, the British colonies in North America aggregated, created a progeny, the constitutional congress, that replaced them, then gave rise to the republic, which gave rise to a slightly different republic, and so on and so forth, with a few forkings off as a given generation of America impregnated other countries (notably Japan 1945) via military, economic or social action (not that those are clearly delineated categories either).&nbsp; <br /><br />I don't have the right statistics to hazard a guess as to what forms are favored by this comparison: the CIA world factbook doesn't let me sort countries by government type.&nbsp; Maybe I could write a script that would pull them in?<br /><br />Anyway, as far as my personal preference, it's still tough, because Social Democracies are great, because everyone's pretty chill, and everyone's more or less taken care of.&nbsp; However, it looks like the maximum enfranchisement of existing citizens leads to barriers being placed on immigration, which leads to small, insular second-class working communitees of foreigners, which naturally leads to racism: familiarity breeds familiarity, but distance fails to disprove contempt.<br /><br />Let me just say that few things will ruin my aesthetic more than tribalism (racism, xenophobia, strong cultural identity, etc).&nbsp; The most appealing system, for me, would foster an absolute minimum level of clade-ishness while <br /><br />-Nick
