Recently finally figured out the Monty Haul problem, after years of confusion and doubt.<br /><br />If you've never heard of this one, good. &nbsp;I'm going to explain it as clearly as I can, with as few gotchas as possible.<br /><br />Imagine that you're on a game show. &nbsp;It's called "1,000 Doors." &nbsp;There are a thousand doors, and behind 1 of them is a prize. &nbsp;You do not know which door the prize is behind, but of course, the host (traditionally named Monty) does. &nbsp;He invites you to pick a door. &nbsp;You do so, and he then opens 998 of the doors, leaving just two unopened, one of which is the door you picked. &nbsp;He doesn't open the doors completely at random, of course: because he already knows where the prize is, and because he's trying to build suspense, he makes sure not to open the door with the prize behind it, if you didn't pick it already. &nbsp;He then invites you to switch your choice: you both know the prize must be behind one of these doors, and you can either take what's behind the one you first picked, or take the one that Monty left unopened. &nbsp;So, should you switch your choice?<br /><br />The odds of you choosing the door that the prize was behind when all the doors were closed is 1 in 1000. &nbsp;The odds of the other unopened door having the prize behind it is 999 in 1000. &nbsp;So yes, of course you should switch your choice.<br /><br />The problem only became famous because of how many people (including celebrated mathematicians and statisticians) disagreed, in effect arguing that both doors give you a 1 in 1000 chance. &nbsp;Which seems ridiculous, but&nbsp;I chose large numbers to help make things more obvious. &nbsp;The proof works for any number of doors, and the original problem was based on a real game show, which used only three doors. &nbsp;So try to imagine: you pick one, Monty opens one, then asks if you want to switch or stay. &nbsp;Hopefully, you can still see that you have a 1 in 3 chance of your initial door being the right one, and a 2 in 3 chance of the other door being the right one. &nbsp;But if not, as I said, you're in good company. &nbsp;Rivers have run black with the ink spilled over this one.<br /><br /><br /><br />-Nick
