At OB, <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/08/a-test-of-moral-progress.html">A Test of Moral Progress</a>: <br /><blockquote>We [<i>White Americans? -Ed</i>] treat each other differently than our distant ancestors treated each other.  In particular we are “nicer”, at least by our lights, to a wider circle of associates.  For example, we enslave, rape, and murder each other less.  The two main explanations offered for this change are:<br /><ol><li><strong>Moral Progress</strong> - We have long wanted to act morally, and some of us have long pondered moral issues.  Relative to what we had thought, these experts have slowly discovered via reason that morality demands that we be nicer to a wider circle of others.  Experts told others, who believed them and wanted to act morally.   So we now more do what reason demands.</li><li><strong>Conditional Morality</strong> - Our evolved moral intuitions are context dependent.  We are built to be nicer to each other when times are good, to invest in an attractive reputation.  We are also built to form alliances with some in order to counter threats by others; the further in social distance are the threats we perceive, the wider a circle of allies we collect in response.  Since we are now richer and have interactions with more distant others, we are nicer to a wider range of allies.</li></ol></blockquote><div></div><div>I'm indirectly heartened by this. &nbsp;Frequently, the rationalist community exposes me to maths and philosophy that my education failed to make me aware of. &nbsp;My pride in the Great Books program, middling in the best of times, shrinks to almost nothing. &nbsp;What's the use of reading <i>Phaedrus</i>&nbsp;when compared to <i>Probability Theory: The Logic of Science</i>? &nbsp;Why read Freud and James when neurology is now a functional science? &nbsp;What's the point of discussing <i>On the Origin of Species</i>, when countless scientist-hours have been spent surveying and expanding and contracting the field, and we're pretty sure of what we know, and the questions which are left to ponder are not ones that will immediately occur to loosey-goosey undergrads?<br /><i><br /></i><br /></div><div></div><div>But ho, what's this!  Some ancient truisms actually hold true<br /></div><div></div><div>Thomas Hobbes!  <br /></div><br />There still seems to be little use for things like, say, Leibniz "proving" that since a windmill cannot see, a brain cannot think.<br /><br />-Nick
