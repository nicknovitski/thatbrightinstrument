This has been going around the alumni network for a while now.&nbsp; He apparently re-sent it a few times.<br /><br />I'm not exactly sure what the single most morally reprehensible doctrinal technology deployed in the Roman Church's history would be.&nbsp; Beatified Martyrdom?&nbsp; Linguistic barriers to the source text?&nbsp; I've been reading Rabelais lately, and he might argue the disenfranchisement of priests led to all kinds of miserly nonsense.&nbsp; Whatever the case, I will openly and heartily campaign that the concept of "prefiguration" deserves to be on the list, as a disease that disproportionately affects/co-opts intelligent people, driving them to what can only properly be called insanity, frequently at great damage to them and great loss to posterity.<br /><br />Human brains see patterns.&nbsp; Which is to say, they are able to make rapid comparisons between things they are looking at and things they have looked at, and notice the similarities between those two perceptions.&nbsp; It's a perfectly natural side-effect of That's what they do.<br /><br />Prefiguration is the .&nbsp; Prefiguration says "Whenever you look at a pancake and see Jesus, you are absolutely right." And what's even worse than that is when it says "This finite text can tell you everything that you need to do, as long as you can find the right way to manipulate it."<br /><br />Prefiguration promises infinite reward for what looks like a finite investment: engendering a life-long obsession with a book.&nbsp; It sounds nice.<br /><br /><blockquote>Dear St. John's classmate,<br /><br />I have been working almost every night &amp; every morning on the book I began writing very feverishly in early August while working for my master's thesis and have had online since late September on <i><b>WEBSITE REDACTED</b></i>.<a href="http://primaryproofsofchristianity.com/" target="_blank"></a><br /><br />THIS WEBSITE SHOWS HOW PRETTY MUCH EVERY WORK IN EVERY PART OF THE ST. JOHN'S PROGRAM PROVES EVERY VERSE OF THE BIBLE TO BE THE VERY WORD OF GOD, INCLUDING THE FACT THAT "THE WHOLE WORLD LIES IN THE POWER OF THE WICKED ONE [SATAN]" (1 John 5:19) who seeks to make people worship things other than Jesus by imitating Jesus &amp; the other persons of the Trinity, as he hints when he says "I will resemble the Most High God." (Isaiah 14:14) For, I have found that perhaps every author on the St. John's Program (including Homer, Plato &amp; Aristotle, Aeschylus-Sophocles-Euripides, Virgil, Plutarch, Shakespeare, Isaac Newton, Immanuel Kant, &amp; Nietzsche) and the people/things they write about (ex. Achilles "the son of a goddess," Odysseus who returns from the world of the dead alive, Aeneas who does the same, Dionysus/Bacchus "the son of a god &amp; a god," Socrates who seeks to save the citizens of Athens); all the non-Christian gods including "virgin-born" Buddha &amp; Crishna; tons of T.V., movie, &amp; music stars or "divas"; and more are types or symbols of Revelation Ch. 13's Antichrist and the false prophet who will cause the whole world to worship the Antichrist in place of God during the 7-year Great Tribulation which is soon to come upon the whole Earth and upon those who have not been raptured by Jesus because they have not put their faith in &amp; followed Him. <br /><br />PLEASE LOOK AT THE WEBSITE WITH THE SAME EXTREME CARE THAT I TOOK IN COMPOSING IT: IT GIVES THE MEANING OF EVERYTHING, EVEN WHY 9/11 HAPPENED, AND GIVES YOU THE KEY TO DISCOVER HOW TO FIND THE MEANING BEHIND EVERY EVENT IN WORLD HISTORY &amp; EVERY OBJECT IN NATURE LIKE THE SUN, ASSUMING THAT YOU "WITHOUT CEASING" (1 Thessalonians 5) PRAY TO GOD FOR WISDOM &amp; UNDERSTANDING AS I DO AND LOOK TO HIM AS THE SOURCE OF EVERY GOOD, AS HE MOST TRULY IS. I WAS SHOCKED TO FIND TWO WEEKS AGO THAT GOD'S FOREKNOWLEDGE OF 9/11 IS SHOWN IN ALMOST EVERY BOOK OF THE BIBLE. PLEASE TELL EVERYONE YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT DISCOVERY SO THAT GOD MAY BE GLORIFIED WORLDWIDE!<br /><br />May the grace of God be with you.<br /><br />Love,<br /><i><b>NAME REDACTED</b></i><br /></blockquote><blockquote>P.S. Please help me in getting this message out to the whole world, and especially to everyone who has read the Great Books at St. John's College. I need all the help I can get. Right now, I am emailing as many SJC students as I can individually and have so far emailed everyone in my class year. PLEASE email me if you are willing to help me at <i><b>EMAIL REDACTED</b></i></blockquote><br /><br />-Nick
