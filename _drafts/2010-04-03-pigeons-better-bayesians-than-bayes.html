I've been wanting to write a post about the Monty Hall problem for a long while, and luckily, some stupid birds have given me a great excuse.<br /><br />Perhaps you've never heard of the Monty Hall problem? &nbsp;So long ago, on the game show Let's Make A Deal, hosted by a man named Monty Hall, there was a recurring game where the contestants were given three doors to choose between. &nbsp;Behind one was nothing. &nbsp;Behind one was a new car. &nbsp;Behind one was an old goat. &nbsp;So Monty would invite the contestant to pick a door. &nbsp;But then it gets unexpected. &nbsp;After they had chosen a door, Monty would then open one of the doors they had <u>not</u> picked, showing them what was behind it. &nbsp;Now there were two closed doors, one of which the contestant had indicated earlier. &nbsp;And then Monty would ask if they wanted to stick with that door as their choice, or if they wanted to switch to the other one.<br /><br />That isn't the Monty Hall problem though. &nbsp;I mean, some people call it that, but I don't. &nbsp;I just call that "playing a particular game on Let's Make a Deal." &nbsp;In my opinion, the real Monty Hall problem is how many people get the question wrong. &nbsp;I mean, of course I did, but brilliant people did, too.<br /><br />But you don't have to be like them. &nbsp;Prepare to learn the secret!<br /><br />I'm currently thinking of a number from 1 to a thousand. &nbsp;If you can guess it, I'll give you five bucks. &nbsp;Go ahead and say your guess aloud. &nbsp;Okay, now, I admit that it's <u>either</u> the number you said, or it's 218. &nbsp;So of those two, which do you think it is now?<br /><br />That's enough said, I hope. &nbsp;But<br /><br /><blockquote>Each pigeon was faced with three lit keys, one of which could be pecked for food. At the first peck, all three keys switched off and after a second, two came back on including the birdâ€™s first choice. The computer, playing the part of Monty Hall, had selected one of the unpecked keys to deactivate. If the pigeon pecked the right key of the remaining two, it earned some grain. On the first day of testing, the pigeons switched on just a third of the trials. But after a month, all six birds switched almost every time, earning virtually the maximum grainy reward.</blockquote>
