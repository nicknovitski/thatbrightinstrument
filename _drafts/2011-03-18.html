Yesterday,&nbsp;<a href="http://globalguerrillas.typepad.com/">John Robb</a>&nbsp;recognized me from our talking the night before, and walked towards me, smiling, holding out a hand for a warm shake.<br /><br />Then I had a date...with a <i>woman</i>.<br /><br />I'm not saying my life is complete, but I need to get some new personal goals. &nbsp;Perhaps some slightly more ambitious ones, too.
