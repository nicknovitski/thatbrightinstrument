<a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Business/story?id=6099188&amp;page=1">Media's Presidential Bias and Decline - ABCnews.com</a><br /><blockquote>The sheer bias in the print and television coverage of this election campaign is not just bewildering, but appalling. And over the last few months I've found myself slowly moving from shaking my head at the obvious one-sided reporting, to actually shouting at the screen of my television and my laptop computer.</blockquote><blockquote>But worst of all, for the last couple weeks, I've begun -- for the first time in my adult life -- to be embarrassed to admit what I do for a living. A few days ago, when asked by a new acquaintance what I did for a living, I replied that I was "a writer," because I couldn't bring myself to admit to a stranger that I'm a journalist.</blockquote><br />What lily-livered nonsense. &nbsp;Let's leave aside that everyone, reporters included, have a pro-winner bias, and Obama doesn't need to win to be every inch a winner, from his unshakeable sun-god gaze to promises of a new life, a new way of living as one family, one tribe...<br /><br />Actually, the strength of his genuine resemblance to Christ-Mithras never really occurred to me before. &nbsp;No wonder he unnerves so many avowedly Christian people: they worry that the chickens have come home to roost, that rhetoric is going to be matched with action and that they're going to be tossed out of the temple like the satanic-gospel-peddling money-changers they are.<br /><br />Hmm. &nbsp;I was talking about journalism. &nbsp;Yeah, let's focus on that.<br /><br />So leaving aside the article's obvious boo-hoo sour-grapes bias, and street-level-lionizing corner-office-demonizing bias, and, let us never forget, the corporate-sponsored bias (Did I really just link to ABC? &nbsp;Will my blog ever be clean again?), all that's left is the general accusation: "A spectre is haunting the newsroom -- the spectre of bias!" &nbsp;Even if this had been presented even-handedly, I would still shake my head in sorrow. &nbsp;Not only is this Not News on the same level as "Professional Baseball Players Aren't Great People, Usually," or "Enforcement Doesn't Deter the Flow of Higly Demanded Goods, For Example Drugs And Cheap Labor," but it is doubly unworthy of notice, because it is using old and un-useful standards to judge the new realities of reporting.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Bias, in the guise of automatic automatic personalization, is the future of news media.</span><br /><br />Actually, when I call it "the future," then pausing via a triumphant paragraph break and waiting for people to nod sagely (since everyone who's anyone knows how great "the future" is), reveals and fosters a bias on my part, so let me put it a better way...<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Everyone wants the information they receive to be biased.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">"Woah, there! &nbsp;I mean, sure, lots of other people like biased media that always reinforces and never challenges their preconceived notions, but they're all ignorant hicks/elitist know-nothings/hate-plagued terrorists/zionist quislings! &nbsp;I, on the other hand, am a seeker after truth! &nbsp;I want balanced reporting! &nbsp;I want.."</span><br /><br />What you want is the appearance of balance, and a feeling that you are a discerning and astute person among similarly-minded people. &nbsp;You want the creators of the content tagged as "news" that you consume to be good at manufacturing this appearance and sensation. &nbsp;You want them to walk you through their even-handed consideration of the bare facts. &nbsp;Credit where credit's due: &nbsp;you are a rationalist stalwart in the fight against the rising "feelings-focused" faux-news (Distinguishing traits: asking people "how that made you feel"). &nbsp;I applaud and hope to share in your down-to-earth-edness. &nbsp;But not everyone shares our preferences, so inasmuch as we want to hear from those who do and overlook those who don't, we seek bias: the sorting and limiting of information returned for a given topical query.<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">"What? &nbsp;That's not what bias is! &nbsp;Bias is when people let their personal feelings cloud their analysis of the truth!"</span><br /><br />Ah, then we are talking about different things. &nbsp;What you are describing is what I would call either "inaccurate," "incomplete" or "misleading" reporting, depending on the details. &nbsp;Details being somewhat annoying to keep track of, many people conflate these terms into a single word, "bias," that is used to refer to any defect of journalism other than bad spelling, especially (not always) journalism that praises things that displease you and denigrates things you admire.<br /><br />With sufficient discernment, the kind of "bias" you refer to can also be seen as universal: human language being what it is, there is no truly "neutral" way of presenting information.<br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;">"What do you mean, 'human language being what it is?' &nbsp;Words have known connotations, and those can "</span><br /><br />I mean that language is inherently imprecise. &nbsp;In fact, the previous sentence is full of imprecision, which partially proves my point: I know exactly what I meant, but there's all kinds of ways you can take it, depending on your particular understanding of/experiences with the words "language," "inherent," and "imprecise". <br /><br />Actually, tThere have been far too many attempts over the years<br /><br />They are doomed to failure from the start, because<br /><br />To quote James Joyce, "Other people are biased, but I am just a little set in my ways."<br /><br />I am equating bias with any editorial process that limits the amount of information we receive. &nbsp;You may think this is 100% fine if done by people whose editing processes you are content to call "rational" or "unbiased." &nbsp;For example, <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> search results are biased towards addresses with a higher page rank, which number is the result of a complex algorithm designed by people who only want you to find the best information you can want. <br /><br />This bias is inescapable. &nbsp;Even if you were to give equal time to all information of any kind, you would be biased towards those events which people tend to report and comment on, as well as those events that affect more people, as well as those events that are spatiotemporally co-incident with human history: events of those kinds would seem to possess greater significance than otherwise, and "significance" (according to any practical meaning) is subjective, though also useful and necessary.<br /><br />Basically, if you can offer<br /><br />This isn't <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;">always</span> what they already believe (it depends on the person, and I personally love having my mind changed, since it makes me feel like I'm correcting and improving in some way), but it usually will be. &nbsp;So the task of the journalist is to provide content, and the more powerful that content is (probably the higher the combined buying power of the customer base, but "buying power" is a stand-in here, since money is just a medium of exchange for power, the thing I wish I could measure), then the more successful a journalist they are.<br /><br />Of course, part of the<br /><br />It's another example of what I've taken to calling the "so-called" bias. &nbsp;It's when you encounter a member of a class that you typically respect who, usually for vague and personal reasons, you don't like. &nbsp;So you try to de-legitimize their membership, prefacing their title with "so-called " or "not a real." &nbsp;For instance, I<br /><br />This is also the first post I've written to this blog that started as a note to a shared item in Reader. &nbsp;The process of converting the one to the other could stand to be much less painless, but I hope to do it more often<br /><br />-Nick
