People talking about Firefly and Battlestar sparked my ire recently<br /><br />Yeah, I've seen the whole show, and it's got its fun moments, but there are two lines in the last episode made which made a stronger impression on me in a shorter amount of time than any network television ever has.&nbsp; Both spoken by the same character, who only appeared in that episode.<br /><br />#1: "Have you ever been raped?"<br />#2: "Well, here we are."<br /><br />If the show was shit (and it isn't), I would still have wanted to struggle through meeting all the lame people on their lame ship, just so this man so completely outside of their understanding could enter their lives and make them think for a brief time "Oh, there's nothing we can do, and we're going to die, and for such simple reasons that all our melodrama seems completely unimportant now."&nbsp; And even when they're saved, and the baddie is instead facing his own minisculity in the face of the uncaring universe and his own slow, inevitable meaningless death...and he just relaxes and flies on into the end of all things.<br /><br />He's the opposite of a Whedon hero: he's someone completely comfortable with who he is.&nbsp; He is someone "admirable," instead of just "entertaining" or "making ends meet in difficult circumstances with a modicum of questionable ethics."<br /><br />A recent (for me) episode of Battlestar Galactica was about a struggle with an enemy ace as a metaphor for a struggle with identity and self-worth.&nbsp; And it was pretty good, but it made me immediately _need_ to watch Space: Above and Beyond.&nbsp; Specifically, The Angriest Angel, an episode with a suspiciously similar plot that, unlike Battlestar, I find tremendously moving.<br /><br />(You know, I'm sure that I'll never remember the name of a single episode of Battlestar.)<br /><br />S:AaB (acronyms hahaha!) is of course the original holder of the "Best Science Fiction Television Show Yet Made That Was Canceled by Fox Before its Time" title, a decade before Firefly or Battlestar.&nbsp; Personally <br />-Nick
