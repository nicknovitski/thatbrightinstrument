[I didn't mean to turn public letter-writing into a thing. &nbsp;Stross just happened to post something recently that really took me by surprise, and which circulated among my friends a bit. &nbsp;I would have posted in the comment thread, but he closed it before I finished organizing my thoughts.]<br /><br /><br />Charlie Stross writing this<br /><br /><br /><blockquote>Content producers who expect to be paid by end-users for access to their content are inevitably going to come into conflict with Google, because this restricts the number of end-users who will see the content, and hence contribute to Google's revenue stream.</blockquote><br /><br />You've lost me. &nbsp;Google is going to ignore robots.txt commands? &nbsp;Google is going to reverse their policy of not fighting advertisement-blocking extensions? &nbsp;I understand the technological and market trends that concern you, but I don't think equating them with any particular company serves your argument well.<br /><br />Regardless:<br /><br /><br /><blockquote>Not all information is created equal, and the cost of compiling and producing something new is disproportionately high. I write books for a living, and take roughly 6-12 months per book.</blockquote><br /><br />If you were almost any other author, I know what I would say.<br /><br />First I would say that after the Protestant Reformation, people built fewer Cathedrals too, but more folks made a living off of religion. <br /><br />Then, I would say that we all want to make a comfortable living doing only what we enjoy, and isn't it a shame that it doesn't always turn out that way.<br /><br />Finally, I would suggest stop wasting time feeling entitled, and start looking at either merchandising or serialized models of publishing.<br /><br />But you're you, so I have to reel in shock for a moment and consider things more closely.<br /><br />It's true that finding and managing revenue streams besides selling books would eat into your time to write books, in the same way that finding and managing concert opportunities or merchandising stores eats into a musician's time to make music. &nbsp;And if production of your style of books or music is particularly time-consuming or cathedral-like, then you're going to need money up front in order to live on your art. &nbsp;This is why there exist specialists willing to grant funding, then attack the problem of making the principal back on commission, letting you focus on your art. &nbsp;Nowadays these are called publishers (or managers or promoters), but what change are you imagining where there will no longer be people who try to make a living by figuring out how to make more money? &nbsp;You aren't alone in your preferences: your market-segment is destined to be served. &nbsp;Continue to announce what you're looking for - as well as actually looking for it - and a neo-publisher will rise to meet you.<br /><br /><br /><blockquote> Google runs on quantifiable data, and the one bit of data I can offer them is that as a data source, including all overheads, I cost on the order of one US cent per byte. </blockquote><br /><br />To Google's credit, they have a great deal of quantifiable data that proves your superiority to the average blog-spam that gets an equal number of hits. &nbsp;First, you represent a "quality result," that people were actually looking for and/or are happy to find. &nbsp;Second, you have a regular, demographically identifyiable Most importantly, when compared to any-old-blog-spam, it's obvious that people actually search for you, want to read your site, and want to repost or link to what you say. &nbsp;Your most valuable mostly-quantifiable trait is doubtless your reputation, your social-central-node-ness. <br /><br />That's where you stand now, but consider all the regular hits that you have at this blog, many from people who treasure your opinion on a wide variety of subjects. &nbsp;Any products which you recommend to them via link could have sales volume data tracked. &nbsp;Any community of fans (or contributors or cultists or whatever you want to call them) which you created and fostered could have unique hits tracked, and which could grow and snowball in its own rights.<br /><br />But perhaps you don't like the idea of blog-ditch-digging, of hawking trinkets by the side of the info-freeway, of Home-Shopping-Networking it up. &nbsp;In short, perhaps you are unyielding in your desire to not monetize your following. &nbsp;In which case, too bad, because you're walking away from money, but then see the above: cafepress is to vanity presses what future "Community Consultants" will be to regular presses. &nbsp;Look for them take care of it.<br /><br />Maybe you feel I'm just another freemunist techno-utopian deflecting responsibility for the future by assuming it can't be steered, only gotten in front of...<em>but I learned it from reading you, dad! &nbsp;I learned it from you!</em>
