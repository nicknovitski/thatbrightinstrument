<a href="http://draft.blogger.com/"></a><span id="goog_1255445810621"></span><span id="goog_1255445810622"></span>The short answer is because most people who have played "Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay" in previous incarnations and talk about it online seem to be really upset about it, to judge from the comment threads on the game's "<a href="http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?etyn=1&amp;ecan=62&amp;epn=0">Edge Minisite</a>."<br /><br />The less short answer: it's being made by <a href="http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/">Fantasy Flight Games</a>, designers of excellent board games (especially ones that blur the boundaries with fiction games), and they are applying those design sensibilities to the creaking edifice of <a href="http://www.games-workshop.com/">Games Workshop</a>'s RPG sideshow, demanding that the accumulated cruft of traditional fiction game systems justify themselves, creating new and useful physical components, and best of all, playtesting the shit out of it. <br /><br />To these old eyes, it is looking white hot. &nbsp;If it isn't the Third Path between Indie and (for current lack of a better term) "The Man" games, then at least it can show what happens when excellent and inclusive design is used to sell big boxes of special dice and glossy paper.<br /><br />But I can say more. &nbsp;What follows is the blow-by-blow summary of the information released so far, with a focus on the bits that excite me. &nbsp;And as a special double-bonus, I'll include the occasional fanboy entitlement-spasm from the comment thread.<br /><br /><a name='more'></a><br /><br />For me, it all started with the video of a seminar Jay Little held at this past Gencon. &nbsp;I think&nbsp;<a href="http://githyankidiaspora.wordpress.com/">Judd</a> linked to it. &nbsp;I found it quite arresting and fascinating stuff, full of astonishing tidbits. &nbsp;Most of what he discusses gets expanded upon in later posts (that is, further down this very page). &nbsp;But here's a significant point: the <a href="http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=752">core boxed set</a> comes with a pack of custom dice, four big full-color books, and passels of cards and sheets. &nbsp;The suggested retail price is $100.<br /><br />That is a big initial investment, and a step very out of line with the typical tiered sales method of rpgs: you hear about a cool game, and to signal interest, you purchase a book, which you then show to your friends, in the hopes that they'll want to signal interest also. &nbsp;Actually playing just increases the chances that you'll tell other people about it, who might also buy, and increases the chances that you'll buy later expansions<br /><br />This set is meant to contain everything any group of four players - and some groups of five or six - need for play: Buy it, and you already have everything you need to play the game with any three people you convince to try it. &nbsp;Put another way: Think of it as buying a very different kind of board game (that is, one with no board or winners or losers and all that other page one Intro to Roleplaying crap).<br /><br />How many books would similarly sized groups need to play D&amp;D 4th? &nbsp;A conservative estimate would be two: the Players Handbook and the Dungeon Master's Guide. &nbsp;But you'll probably want at least one extra PHB, to clear the bottleneck when two different people have questions, and an adventure would be nice, and maybe a book of monsters, and if you're interested in a fancy type of character or a different setting...Spending $100 on a game for four is actually something that's done a surprising amount. &nbsp;It's just all the active ingredients finally collected in a single pill.<br /><br />Commenter MVP: Sunatet<br /><blockquote><i><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">"In the old REAL warhammer I can take 2 dice, ONE book (love the 2-nd edition hard cover), some of my own printed and disposable handouts, paper and pencil, go out in the woods, to the sea, or whenever I like in the day, or night, and play with my players without worries that my beautifull handouts/skill cards/whatever will be destroyed in the process, without worrying that I loose my unique precious dice (I can buy d10 in EVERY game shop). THAT is where Warhammer spirit IS. THAT is what REAL Warhammer IS. Not this shitty tabletop game, with it's fragile cards, that requires lots of table space (basing on those movies)."</span></i><br /></blockquote><br />Next they posted an&nbsp;<a href="http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=756">FAQ</a>. &nbsp;Notable entries:<br /><br /><ul><li>The new edition was designed to provide new roleplayers "an accessible,&nbsp;customisable and engaging roleplaying system," and veterans "some new and interesting options&nbsp;to add to their roleplaying experience."</li><li>"More than a dozen different core mechanics for task resolution&nbsp;were designed, evaluated, and tested over the course of the development&nbsp;of the new edition of Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay, including&nbsp;some more traditional task resolution models." After settling on dice pools as offering the right feel, "a&nbsp;number of different dice pool models were developed&nbsp;and tested, until we settled on the the system that combined the&nbsp;engaging play experience we wanted with the mechanical results&nbsp;that could drive the system’s engine."</li></ul><br />Commenter MVP: Peacekeeper_b<br /><i></i><br /><i><blockquote><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">"You are pretty funny. You are all so protective and defensive over a system you havent even played yet, and we are all sad and grumpy cause we are losing a game we have played and paid for. Yes we can still play with the old rules, but you know what, that isnt the point."</span><br /></blockquote><blockquote><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">"You know what, nevermind. Obviously people who are not happy with a new edition are not suppose to post on this site anymore."</span><br /></blockquote></i>Next comes <a href="http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=764">a broad overview of the process of character creation</a>.<br /><br />Step 1: Choose a race...but we've already gone astray. &nbsp;Properly speaking, characters in this system have an <i>ethnicity</i>, a culture which also has an attendant species. &nbsp;Thus, we have Elves Who Live In The Woods, Elves Who Live In Their Cities, Humans Who Live in Reikland (a province of "The Empire," which is more benign than it sounds) and Dwarves Who Live in Karak Azgaraz (a recently founded stronghold). &nbsp;These are the four types of folks most frequently found running around Reikland, wherein the base set is...set.<br /><br />It's not the first time, but I'm still happy see another game go the <i>Elder Scrolls</i> route, saying "you're from somewhere, and you were shaped by the majority culture of that place." &nbsp;Admittedly, there are only four choices.<br /><br />Step 2: Draw three cards from the deck of careers<br /><br /><br />Commenter MVP: captainflakk<br /><blockquote><i><span style="font-size: small;">"No Halflings???!!!"</span></i><br /></blockquote><br />Commenter MVP: the_crom<br /><span style="color: #a9adb8; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"></span><br />Wow. How quickly the sheeple fall into line. What happened to everybody who was complaining about this game? Did they just stop bothering to check in to see what's going on?<br />At the risk of being called elitist, I'm going to reiterate. This is NOT a roleplaying game. This is a board game that is trying to emulate a roleplaying game. A roleplaying game is about imagination, its about a world built entirely in the head of the players. The rules are there to provide a framework to resolve actions. They are not there to force players to work together, to act a certain way, or even to build a story. The players do that. At its finest, an RPG doesn't even need rules. Some of the best adventures I've ever played in, the dice were never rolled. Could you do that with this game? The tension meter is the game's mechanics interfering with the player's dynamics. Same with the crazy dice. I'm disgusted at this game. It's a dishonor to the fine tradition of Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay.<br />From what I hear, Fantasy Flight Games already tried to release this product under a different name and it was a horrible flop. So now that the have the Warhammer Fantasy license, they're just using the license at the expense of the current players. (Who liked the game, by the way.) Is there any truth to that statement, or is that just a nasty rumor?<br /><br /><br />Finally, and most recently, we have a post on <a href="http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=850">Scene Structure and Budgeting</a>. &nbsp;The most interesting point I take from it is that after every delineated "act" in the adventure, there will be something called the "rally step," which seems to have a purpose like the refresh scenes of Solar System.<br /><br /><blockquote><i>The rally step is when characters and players alike can catch their breath. In-game, it is a chance for characters to reorient, rearm, and refocus – the PCs have a brief respite, just enough time to bind a wound, draw a sword, notch an arrow, and prepare for what comes next. In out-of-character terms it is the pause for bathroom breaks, drink refills, nagging rules questions, and off-topic asides.</i><br /></blockquote><br />In general, the emphasis on structure leads to . &nbsp;Though it does make it sound slightly less character-driven.<br /><br />Let's talk about <a href="http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=859">how to attack in combat</a>.<br /><br />commenter MVP: Akherion<br />Is there a card for the most important thing called: FREEDOM OF ACTION ?????
