So I've bought Meg Baker's 1001 Nights, and since played two games with it.<br /><br />For me to say "It's great!" is a lot like someone else saying "It's legible!"&nbsp; That is, I am accused of being very forgiving of faults and very exuberant about everything else.&nbsp; So, in order to provide a more useful overview, I'll try to be a little more detailed.<br /><br />1001 Nights is probably the best introduction to roleplaying I've personally encountered, where by "best" I mean, "Most likely to make a new player realize that this activity is fun and that they can do it."<br /><br />Daniel played Baba Mustapha, the Assistant Cook<br /><ul><li>I grumble when people don't pay attention to me.</li><li>I love to see children smile</li><li>I am followed by the scent of burnt food.</li><li>My cooking is an acquired taste.</li><li>My skin is as that of a date.<br /></li></ul>Ananya played Zoulika, the Astrologer.<br /><ul><li>I am deaf in my right ear.</li><li>I can see when people are lying.</li><li>The smell of vanilla keeps me awake.</li><li>My mouth twitches at the taste of honey.</li><li>I touch others with my sensitivity.</li></ul>Sara played&nbsp; <br />I've donated the game to the Library I founded at St. John's.&nbsp; I want to own a copy again someday (and it will be someday, since I'm hoping to minimize my financial footprint as much as possible over the next six months or so), but it just seemed like the perfect game to have available communally, to be used to introduce people to roleplaying over and over again.<br /><br />-Nick
