Fool is a game for three to five (or so) people, played using a regular deck of cards.&nbsp; It's Russian.&nbsp; Or at least, I learned it from a Russian, and they claimed the game was also Russian.&nbsp; Who can say for certain?<br /><br />Set-Up:<br /><br />Deal six cards to each player. &nbsp;Then draw one more card and put it face up in the center of the table. &nbsp;It's still part of the deck, though...you may want to put it at the bottom, sideways, so everyone can see its value and also draw cards from the deck.<br /><br /><br /><br />-Nick
