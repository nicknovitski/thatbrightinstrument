I got the chance, while in San Francisco recently, to see Red Line at the Viz Theatre.<br /><br />Actually, if it didn't prominently feature a race called the red line,<br />and a song about a red line in English , I would recommend that they<br />release it here as Love Race 3000, because based on my direct<br />experience, anything less subtle than that will have nerds saying shit<br />like " that ending was stupid."<br /><br />No spoilers: it's not stupid, it's exactly what 80% of the film was<br />prefiguring, but I suspect it will prove a great sorting mechanism for<br />the wrong type of geek.  "Your understanding of film and romantic<br />activity must be at least this tall to ride."<br /><br />Maybe I just feel this way because of an increased sensitivity I get in California, or specifically because the look the girl at the frozen yogurt counter was giving me, but it seemed very clear to me that Redline is a film that wants to get you excited to go out to do things, in pursuit of eventually doing someone.  Here we are, watching a film that dazzled our senses with images and sounds of a hyperkinetic retrotech million-mile-an-hour race, and the love interest is saying right to our faces, "I'm not like you idiots who just want to sit and watch!"<br /><br />The main character ("JP," possibly the most perfect protagonist name<br />in all of anime history) is racing because she said that.  He doesn't<br />want to be the best, he wants to follow her to where she's going.  He<br />wants to be the man worthy of her.<br /><br />We've all seen anime where the protagonist's sexual desire is<br />sublimates into some sport or magical dueling tradition or whatever<br />else.  When these anime are for children, innocence and childish<br />bullheadedness is lionized.  How great these kids are, that they<br />remain children, innocent of the horrible truth about life: your<br />desire for achievement and interpersonal dominance is eventually<br />drained off into painful and meaningless expenditures of seed!<br /><br />When these anime are for adults (okay, I've seen at least one, maybe a<br />short in robot carnival?), the characters are eunuchs, sacrificing<br />their generative passion for power in some other sphere.  Sometimes<br />this is explicitly called out as disturbing and crazy.<br /><br />Redline is the other way around.  The chase for the woman, or rather,<br />the chase of men and women everywhere to cross the red line together,<br />is celebrated.  Even the people who don't cross it in the film sweat<br />and pant in post-coital satisfaction, less jealous than admiring of<br />those who made it.  Millennium Actress all over again: the chase<br />itself is fun, if you don't hate yourself or life.<br /><br />Ah, I may have also been biased by watching the Satoshi Kon oeuvre on<br />the occasion of his death.<br /><br />In the film, the redline is a race that happens wherever it wants to.<br />It doesn't ask permission.  (You know, LIKE LOVE GODDAMMIT). This<br />year, it happens on Roboworld, a militarized planet that doesn't want<br />people to see behind it's iron curtain, and which deploys a series of<br />preposterous barriers to people who want to celebrate speed and life.<br />I looked pretty closely, and I don't think they are America, just the<br />forces for militarized conduct, who insist that the pride and<br />prominence of the nation state is the highest aim, and who want you to<br />Lie Back and Think of England rather than Fuck When You Feel Like It.<br /><br />They do have a super weapon, Red Herring, DBA Funky Boy.  I was a<br />little sad that didn't go anyplace.  Though it did allow the line "Mr.<br />President, we can't let Funky Boy destroy Roboworld!"<br /><br />Most characters participating in the race (except perhaps the five<br />time cyber-champ) acts like they have their own show and career, and<br />are only appearing in this movie as a favor to the producers, Wacky<br />Racers style.  This illusion is heightened by one team actually having<br />been in a too-short piece called Trava.  I wanted more of those<br />characters, and here they are!  Now we just need a Gori-rider movie,<br />and a Lynchman and Johnny Bouya 6 ep OVA.<br /><br />Oh, another exception: I think one of the racing duos is just the<br />director and lead artist or something.  Even they have a role to play<br />in this grand drama.<br /><br />The cyber champ is actually the indictment of the Ash Eunuchum<br />character I mentioned before.  He has gradually ceased to identify his<br />car as a means to an end, an existence separate from himself.  Purity<br />of purpose means he regards the real point of the exercise as a<br />distraction.  He's the winner and that's that.  More and more robotic<br />parts were added to him, until his head is shaped like an engine block<br />and he mainlines his nitro.  Oh, and he calls himself the King of<br />Kings and poses like a crucifix in his final form.  You know, IN CASE<br />YOU WEREN'T SURE.
