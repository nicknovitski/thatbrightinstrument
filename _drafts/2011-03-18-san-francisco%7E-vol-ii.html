THE HOUSE: A pre-Civil War carriage house smack in Hayes Valley. Two bedrooms upstairs, living/dining room, bathroom and kitchen in the final throes of a remodel. Down stairs is a yard, a garden level bedroom, and the garage, which has basically been converted into our studios (you'll get a station in the studio).<br /><br />We're a "Watch TV where you masturbate household," which roughly translates to not in shared spaces unless you're feeling exhibitionistic. We have frequent, though not constant, guests who join us for breakfast, or tea, or a glass of wine. No couch surfers unless they're in bed with you. We LOVE musicals.<br /><br />We'd like to share food, but we're on conflicting schedules so that's not happening too much right now. We LIVE for Brunch, especially on Sunday. Our kitchen is blessed with a 1920's ish farmhouse Wedgewood named Viviane. Her oven doesn't work at the moment so we're stovetop boys. Open (though admittedly resistant) to the possibility of a toaster oven in the mean time if it's a must for ya.<br /><br />"The Most Wonderful Time of the Year" is just around the corner. Actually, it's here. The Wysteria has started blooming as of this week! The smell will intoxicate you when it gets up to full speed and you will lay in bed entranced by the bountiful purple cakes of blossoms dangling outside your bedroom window. Spring is a miraculous time here.<br /><br />Includes utilities (gas, electric, and water), internet, and laundry.<br /><br />Ample bike parking.<br /><br />YOU: Comfortable with animals: Dood, an 88 pound chuck of sheer muscle and love, and Iola, a middle aged cat with an agenda of her own. Tidy without being OCD. Engaged but not fixated. Active. Spacey but grounded. Probably an early-thirty-something faggot, but we're open to explore. Employed or independently wealthy. Kind. Comfortable with process, but able to solidify into product when necessary.<br /><br />US: Two aforementioned early-thirty-something-faggots. Ralph works in costume design and food service and dreams of lemonade. Will is a full time student with no idea what he does although it generally resembles a chicken running around with its head cut off. We try and do our dishes before we eat, support each other in healthy choices, and laugh together.<br /><br />And we look forward to meeting you.
