I've heard the phenomenon described before. &nbsp;"I started reading an article on Wikipedia, and it linked to another and another, and before I knew it, hours had passed!"<br /><br />It has finally happened to me. &nbsp;Yesterday I clicked back to the site's front page, and noticed that "On this Day in History," <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Miracle_of_the_Sun">tens of thousands of people in rural Portugal saw the sun spin around</a>.<br /><br />I'm not sure exactly what prompted me to open <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:The_Miracle_of_the_Sun">the discussion page</a>, beyond a sudden fear of being an internet-Eloi, knowing nothing of the blessed Morlocks laboring to bring me this treasured information source. &nbsp; Logic and experience both tell me that Wikipedia articles are icebergs, or rather mountains, hiding behind a modest face the lengthy struggle of vast and occult forces. &nbsp;I wanted my information to have a story! &nbsp;Wikipedia as the farmer's market of the internet, minimal alienation (indeed, frequent identification) between producers and consumers!<br /><br />This was my first encounter with Pat, and the first step on a journey to<br /><br />It's<br /><br />Pat's career as an editor began&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=&amp;user=Pat8722&amp;page=&amp;year=2005&amp;month=12&amp;tagfilter=">December 15th 2005</a>, and effectively ended &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the nature of Wikipedia makes it difficult or impossible to know whether he had<br /><br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Pat8722">Every single edit he made in his brief career</a> can be viewed, searched, indexed, briefed, debriefed and numbered.<br /><br />When an anonymous editor asked why there seemed to be only pictures of the crowd, not the apparition itself, Pat claimed that the picture currently in the article did in fact show the miracle. &nbsp;"You can see from the picture that the sun is darker than the light which it is radiating." &nbsp;He continued: "To the best of my knowledge, the picture was not published until 1951. It would be reasonable to suppose there were other photos of the sun too, <b>but it may take years, and the fulfillment of the message, before they are finally published</b>."<br /><br /><br />"I am pleased that Arbcom has agreed to take this case, and I thank you for it. I have briefly reviewed the accusations at Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Pat8722/Evidence, and I believe that I will conclusively demonstrate for Arbcom that I properly understood and have followed all wikipedia policy, and that my accusers have not, and that the admins who blocked me should either be stripped of the admin power (if they have been blocking others, also, without policy basis) or admonished not to do it again (if they have not been using the admin power for political purposes consistently). There are many important issues raised on the talk pages in my defense that go the credibility of Wikipedia. Unfortunately, <b>I am presently involved in six court cases as a pro se litigant</b> (meaning I represent myself - no attorney), one of which is facing a jurisdictional deadline for a petition for review with the state supreme court, and four of which are at the state court lower appellate level, also facing demanding deadlines, and one of which is in the discovery phase in the trial court, which the trial judge refuses to place on hold while I attend to the matters under appeal. Those cases can't be set aside, and are presently absorbing 150% of my time, if that were possible. Because I understand the importance of Wikipedia, I had been editing on Sundays, but the demands on my time are such that they are now even absorbing my Sunday time. I would like Arbcom to put this matter on hold until my apellate court cases are resolved (probably months). I would agree to notify Arbcom when my appeals in the state courts are over (or federal court, if that's where they lead). I would agree not to edit Wikipedia in the interim. If Arbcom does not put this matter on hold, I will be unable to participate in my own defense (i.e. unable to point out the relevant facts and show I applied the applicable policies.) I believe I will certainly be vindicated by Arbcom if I am allowed to particpate in my own defense, and that the admins who have been blocking me will likely be stripped of the admin power. I am expecting the best of Arbcom, because without it, wikipedia is going to lose all hopes for credibility. I am expecting that this is the point where a "due process" review is had, and as understood for centuries, means the right to have stated the accusations against oneself, in terms of citations to facts and citations to the policies the acts allegedly violate, the right to present one's own defense (which means the opportunity (time) in which to do so) in terms of citing fact and demonstrating that the applicable policies were followed, and, finally, to be presented with a concusion reached by jurors (you) based upon a stated reasoned application of the policies, to the facts as determined by you. I will check back in with Wikipedia today and next Sunday, hoping that you have agreed to place this matter on "hold", until I have time to particpate. Thank you for your consideration.pat8722 16:14, 20 August 2006 (UTC)"<br /><br />http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Pat8722<br /><br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Pat8722#Log_of_blocks_and_bans">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Pat8722#Log_of_blocks_and_bans</a><br /><br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Pat8722/Workshop">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Pat8722/Workshop</a><br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Pat8722">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Pat8722</a><br /><br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Pat8722">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Pat8722</a><br /><br />But I for one can't help but think <a href="http://www.nnseek.com/e/rec.arts.sf.tv/trying_to_locate_name_of_an_original_star_trek_epi_119549789t.html">this post on nnseek</a> (feb 25 2008) must be&nbsp;from the same guy.<br /><br />I remember a Star Trek episode (original series) where there was an&nbsp;alien creature who drew its life from the energy created by other's&nbsp;anger and hatred, and therefore was instilling anger in everyone in&nbsp;order to continue to live, and that it was growing stronger in that it&nbsp;was succeeding in making everyone fight, and that they finally killed&nbsp;the creature by realizing what the creature was doing, and ceasing&nbsp;their animosities and laughing. I can't locate the name of that&nbsp;episode, and I don't remember which year it came out. Can anyone tell&nbsp;me the name of that episode?<br /><br />It was <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUeB0zAm9Uw">Day of the Dove</a>, buddy, but sometimes it can feel like that every day, am I right?
