Two days ago a large box arrived from my mother.&nbsp; "Damn.&nbsp; This is probably going to be depressing mementos from my grandmother's deathbed, like a last package of socks or an unfinished note in shaky handwriting or a sample of ashes.&nbsp; Not exactly the emotional boost I was hoping for today."<br /><br />Oh yeah, my grandfather caught pneumonia and died, and my grandmother's radiation therapy put her under soon after.&nbsp; He has been trapped in Parkinson's-caused catatonia for nearly a decade, and she had been trapped in the house with him.&nbsp; By this point, their dying was less surprising than their continuing to live.&nbsp; I don't regret the amount or quality of the time I spent with them.&nbsp; Things like this happen.<br /><br />Anyway, I was right about that box, except that it also had a bunch of wrapped presents.&nbsp; Why is that?&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; Right!&nbsp; My birthday is on Saturday!&nbsp; I mean, not that <br /><br /><br /><br />I wouldn't call my age a sore subject.&nbsp; Barring mishap or a degradation of my lifestyle's health quotient (unlikely, if even possible), I figure I still have a good decade in me at the same level I currently perform at.&nbsp; But it's been a nagging<br /><br />It's not like <br />-Nick
