So as part of their commitment to the next-generation open social network ecosystem, Blogger has added a feature where you can "follow" other feeds.&nbsp; This is much like a friends list on livejournal, except divorced from the concept of a "friend": a feed can be a person you know, or just someone you think is entertainingly crazy, or updates for software that you use, or whatever.&nbsp; All updates for these feeds appear at the bottom of your blogger dashboard, much like a cramped and less useful friends page.&nbsp; Luckily, they are also automatically imported to <a href="http://reader.google.com/">Google Reader</a> under the tag "Blogs I follow", and reader is a feed aggregating interface I find amenable.<br /><br />The advantage of "following" is that it can be done publicly.&nbsp; Not only can I include a gadget showing my allegiances (an abbreviated list, in my case, since I follow nearly 200 feeds and blogs) but those.<br /><br />This latter feature currently only works for blogger users, but work it does: I can follow people, and when they see me following, they can decide whether what I say is of interest to them, and begin following me.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />This <br /><br />The social web is a world of followers.&nbsp; <br /><br />-Nick
