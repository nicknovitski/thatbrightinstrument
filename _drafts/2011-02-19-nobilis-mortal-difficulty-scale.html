compared to the typical Nobilis game, the majority of opposed actions in this system, especially at the beginning of a campaign, will be occurring on the Mortal scale.  Whenever a player's character attempts to do something that someone else is actively trying to stop, you'll need to know the other character's level of intention.  If they are statted characters that are significant to the plot, then you'll know what they're trying anyway, but when you need to improvise...uhh, I guess, donâ€™t, and use this chart instead.<br /><br />If the npc...<br />    is just going through the motions, or has a very divided attention, they spent 1 will.<br />    takes the task moderately seriously, they spent 2.<br />    cares a lot about it, to the point that their personal life suffers, they spent 3<br />    is obsessed, or in fear for their life or something equally important to them, either from some threat that they were expecting to face, or right after their life has just suffered a serious crisis (IE, "The Kukla is attacking!" not "Those guys over there are attacking!"), they spent 4.<br /><br />If the NPC<br />...is famously terrible at the related skill, subtract 1<br />...neither cares about what their doing nor has any experience in this field, add 0<br />...has been instructed in the field, or probably has a personal reason to be doing it, add 1<br />...is practiced and confident, or definitely has a personal reason to do it, add 2<br />...has been doing this for a living for most of their adult life, or is known for being gifted in the field, or cares about the thing at stake as much as their own life, add 3<br /><br />if the NPC<br />...cripplingly bad tools or under terrible conditions, subtract 1 or 2<br />...has very good tools or assistants, add 1<br />...has incredible and magical tools or help, add 2<br />...has unique tools, add 3<br />   (scales up to max of 6)<br /><br />If the NPC is part of a group of...<br />...5 people, add 1<br />...50 people, add 2<br />...500 people, add 3<br />...5000 or more, add 4
