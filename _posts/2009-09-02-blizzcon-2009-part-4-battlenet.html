Okay, the heavy stuff's out of the way. &nbsp;Now I want to talk about some specific bits in the announced plans that were intriguing to me. &nbsp;Blizzard, as I said in part 1, is staffed by serious professional folks what think hard about their goals and efforts. &nbsp;That their games will be at least "good" is a foregone conclusion. &nbsp;What attracts me is the parts that will be new or different, or which give insight into what direction these serious hard-thinkers see the marketplace of play going in the future.<br /><br />The first thing I want to talk about is how they want to leverage their fan base into a social network.<br /><br />Of old, Blizzard games which were played online used an in-game matchmaking service called "Battle.net." &nbsp;There had been games that could be played with across local and non-local networks before, and there had been external applications that polled available game servers and launched the game with a double-click, but Battle.net was the first time a company said "it is part of our game that you play with everyone else who has our game."<br /><br />From the beginning until its last major release, it has taken the same basic form: you can click the "connect to battle.net" button (next to and below the "play alone" and "play with people close by" buttons), you're asked to log in, and then are carried to a set of chat channels for everyone who's connected at that moment (private channels optional), as well as a tool for searching and filtering the games currently being run.<br /><br />The new design is primarily inspired by the two communication paradigms that displaced the chat channel: the instant messenger, and the profile page w/status updates. &nbsp;Well, I admit that the use of the word "paradigm" is my own sin; the designers at the panel were practical enough to instead list examples they thought "worked well": Google Talk and Facebook (as well as the current premier online-game-serving platforms, XBox Live and Steam).<br /><br />I would characterize the strategy as to make Battle.net, to the limits of the particular game, no longer a separate "type" of play, but melded to the core experience as closely as possible: social play becoming an extension of play. &nbsp;Or, rather, the social play which has always existed becoming co-opted as much as possible. &nbsp;It has always been the case that even games which you play by yourself, you discuss with friends (or, at least, barring severe anxieties, would enjoy discussing with friends). &nbsp;People will try to tell you that the only interaction between players of <i>Donkey Kong</i> was to displace one another on the high score list, but that's bullshit: <i>Donkey Kong</i> players interacted all the time, whenever they met and spoke to one another and counted <i>Donkey Kong</i> among their shared passions. &nbsp;Do we say that only music played in concerts is social? &nbsp;Do readers of books lack a shared culture, because they necessarily pursue their hobby alone? &nbsp;All that's being attempted is to make the game include a convenient nexus for that excitement.<br /><br />But this is all by way of letting you down easy. &nbsp;The ire-raising truth is: not only will you only be able to play <i>Starcraft 2</i> with other people via Battle.net, you won't even play it <i>alone</i>&nbsp;without it. &nbsp;In the future, all Blizzard games will start by asking you to log in to the service, much as <i>World of Warcraft</i> does. <br /><br />There are many who will see this as an inconvenience and imposition. &nbsp;For some of these people, it will be true. &nbsp;But modern gaming has been vastly enhanced by an at least intermittent internet connection for some time now, and tens of millions of people play games that require them. &nbsp;Can't close the barn door after the ship has sailed, etc.<br /><br />There are compensatory advantages. &nbsp;First, as with <i>World of Warcraft</i>, all the data particular to your account can be saved on remote servers, accessible no matter what computer you use. &nbsp;Get to level 4 at work, then play up to level 6 on your desktop at home, then get on your Virgin America cross-country flight with GoGo wireless internet service and power through the rest on your laptop.<br /><br />(Dear Richard Branson: I heart your airline.)<br /><br />The second is the&nbsp;Facebook wrinkle I was mentioning before: "friend" will become a tiered concept. &nbsp;Currently, in World of Warcraft, it is possible to add any character you meet to a "friends list," which essentially acts as a list of quick-dial contact information. &nbsp;So if level 76 paladin "xXxDethStrikexXx" turned out (incredibly) to be a pleasure to play with, you can make a personal note of it, after which point you can see at a glance if they are online, and call them up later to play with again. &nbsp;Which is good, because it is possible to make friends via the game. &nbsp;But recall that&nbsp;the aforementioned paladin is only one character, whose player might switch back and forth between several others. &nbsp;If you only know him as the paladin, you won't recognize his warlock. &nbsp;This especially becomes a problem when you're trying to connect to people whom you know in real life. <br /><br />Hence the concept of "Real ID," a social-network-style friending that lets consenting users connect via their Battle.net accounts. &nbsp;You can search for people by their email address, after which point they show up in your friends list under the real name by which you know them. &nbsp;And since all future Blizzard games will be using Battle.net, you'll be able to send them messages even if you're playing <i>Starcraft</i>&nbsp;and they're playing <i>Diablo</i>.<br /><br />As with Facebook, the system will also support status updates (are we going to someday give up and just call them "tweets," in the same way adhesive strips became "band-aids"?) broadcast to all your Real ID friends, and you'll even get a notifications feed as your friends get achievements in whatever-they-happen-to-be-playing. &nbsp;Or&nbsp;you can always go to your friends profile page to see all the achievements they've gotten in supported Blizzard games, doubtless with further unannounced (possibly undesigned) functionality.<br /><br />Battle.net already ties into the official Blizzard store, allowing you to download and re-download any games you purchase from them or register with them, and the official Blizzard forum, awarding you with icons/avatars corresponding to your WoW character's appearance. &nbsp;That feature is slated to be expanded: many <i>Starcraft 2 </i>achievements will award specific icons for your profile, and with a common achievement system across all games, adding that functionality to <i>World of Warcraft</i>&nbsp;is probably inevitable. &nbsp;As well, the icons could be made usable in-game: when you play&nbsp;<i>Starcraft 2</i>,&nbsp;all your units and buildings will be painted with your chosen mark.<br /><br />In short, Battle.net is to become integral to the Blizzard brand: a platform for collecting and focusing the thousand suns of fan creativity and excitement, and a part of what makes each game good. &nbsp;I suspect that most people will adjust to the move, as long as the service lives up to the usability expectations set by the games (and really, an interface is an interface is an interface). <br /><br />But there are and will be critics. &nbsp;In fact, I spoke to one just after the Battle.net panel. &nbsp;To paraphrase our conversation:<br /><br /><i>"I don't like that. &nbsp;I don't want my friends to be messaging me when I'm raiding."</i><br /><i><br /></i><br />"Well, you can just ignore them."<br /><br /><i>"No, my friends are really insistent."</i><br /><i><br /></i><br />"Well, you can just tell them that you're busy, and that you can't talk right now. &nbsp;You could even set your status to that, so they'd know why you can't play with them."<br /><br /><i>"You don't know my friends."</i><br /><br />"I hope I never do."<br /><br />-Nick
