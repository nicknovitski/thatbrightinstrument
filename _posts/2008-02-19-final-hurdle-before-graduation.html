<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 100%;">So after some early mishaps, I wrote <a href="http://docs.google.com/Doc?id=dhm89zgn_188g8tz9wcn">my last annual essay</a>.  It's about War &amp; Peace, which is a great book now available in a new best-ever translation, but you don't really need to have read the book to understand the essay.  I'm fairly proud of it, though I wish I had more time to write it in, since I had more to say, but it's my own fault that I didn't.  </span><br /><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 100%;"><br /></span><br /><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 100%;">It's written and accepted, but the fun doesn't end there!</span><br /><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 100%;"><br /></span><br /><div style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 100%;">Now that your essay writing  period is over, we write to give you information about your oral examinations.   Please review this memo and let us know if you have any questions.</span><br /></div><div style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 100%;">As stated in our catalog, an  approved senior essay requires an hour-long public examination by a  committee of three tutors who have judged the essay to be acceptable.   All senior essay oral examinations will be scheduled outside of class  hours so that you (and your classmates) will be able to attend orals  without missing class.  </span><br /></div><ul style="font-style: italic;"><ul><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 100%;"><b><u>Place:</u></b>    All senior oral examinations take place in the King William Room in  the Barr Buchanan Center.  Prior to the exam, you will don your  cap and gown in the Robing Room across from the King William Room.</span>  </ul></ul><ul style="font-style: italic;"><ul><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 100%;"><b><u>Dates</u></b>: Monday,  February 18 through Thursday, February 28 (prior to Spring Break); and</span>  </ul></ul><div style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 100%;">Monday, March 17 through Friday, May  2</span><br /></div><div style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 100%;"><b><u>What You Need to Do and  Remember</u></b>:</span><br /></div><ul style="font-style: italic;"><ol type="1"><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 100%;">So that visitors    may have some idea of your essayâ€™s content, you will begin by <b><u>   delivering a brief summary of your paper</u></b>.  Two minutes    in length is a suitable time.  Please read it very audibly, and    continue to speak audibly throughout the oral.  The examination    is meant to be public, and the audience will appreciate being able to    hear the conversation.</span></li></ol></ul><span style="font-style: italic;">  </span><br /><ul style="font-style: italic;"><ol start="2" type="1"><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 100%;">The most successful    orals are those that develop most like a conversation.  As in a conversation,    you are entitled to take the initiative if you feel the discourse flagging. </span></li></ol></ul><span style="font-style: italic;">  </span><br /><div style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 100%;"><b><u>Protocol:</u></b>   We have attached the oral examination protocol. Please read it so that  you are familiar with the procedure.</span></div><ul style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 100%;">1. Members of the audience  must arrive before the time scheduled for the examination. <b><u> No one should enter the King William Room after the oral has begun or  before it ends except in an emergency. </u></b></span>  </ul><ul style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 100%;">2. The examining committee  and the student who is to be examined gather in the robing room at least  five minutes before the examination is to begin.  A member of the  committee reviews the protocol with the student.</span>  </ul><ul style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 100%;">3. Two of the committee  members enter the King William Room before the student, and the audience  rises.  These committee members take their places at the table  and remain standing.  The third member enters with the student  and closes the door.  </span>  </ul><ul style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 100%;">4. The third committee member  tips his (or her) hat to the Chair and says**:</span>  </ul><ul style="font-style: italic;"><ul><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 100%;">Mr. (or Madam) Chair,  I present ___________, candidate for the degree of Bachelor of Arts to be examined on his (or her)  essay entitled "_________________".</span>  </ul></ul><ul style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 100%;">5. The Chair asks everyone  to be seated.</span>  </ul><ul style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 100%;">6. The Chair asks the student  for a brief summary of the essay, and (if necessary) ENCOURAGES EVERYONE  TO SPEAK AUDIBLY. </span>  </ul><ol start="7" style="font-style: italic;" type="1"><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 100%;">Promptly after one    hour, the Chair announces the end of the examination.  As the audience    rises, the student, followed by the committee, leaves the King William    Room and returns to the robing room.  The student vacates the robing    room as soon as possible so that the committee members may confer.</span></li></ol><br />Mine is on the 26th, during lunch.  The height of inconvenience!  Anyone interested and able is welcome.<br /><br />-Nick
