Hey!  I just got my first comment spam!  Awesome!<br /><br />Everyone, say hello to <a href="http://www.blogger.com/profile/16429256023975411388">my first spammer, quarterinchline</a>!&nbsp; He practices a form of email marketing so primitive that it's usually done by computer programs only a few dozen lines long!<br /><br />No, I am not telling you what he was advertising.&nbsp; That would be rewarding him.<br /><br />-Nick
