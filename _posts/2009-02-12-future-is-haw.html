As of today, I use <a href="http://reader.google.com/">Google Reader</a> to follow 249 feeds and websites.&nbsp; I remove some as they go defunct, or as my opinions and interests shift, and of course I add new ones as I encounter them, but in general, that's the normal number I've been following since soon after I started using the service.&nbsp; Maybe the less said about my obsessive reading habits the better; I don't find reading that many to be a chore - much the opposite, in fact - but I have been annoyed by the task of sorting them into helpful categories.<br /><br />Two of the outliers that both defy easy classification, yet clearly constitute a group, are John Robb's <a href="http://globalguerrillas.typepad.com/">Global Guerillas</a> and Dmitri Orlov's <a href="http://cluborlov.blogspot.com/">ClubOrlov</a>.<br /><br />John Robb is the author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470261951?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thatbriginst-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0470261951">Brave New War: The Next Stage of Terrorism and the End of Globalization</a><img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=thatbriginst-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0470261951" style="border: medium none ! important; margin: 0px ! important;" width="1" />, and the chief proselytizer of the Resilient Communities meme, which basically says that much of the world will soon be like much of Iraq - as he puts it, a "Bazaar of Violence" - and the only way you're going to have any say in your lifestyle (and, you know, life) in the future is either to engineer a an artificial tribe (a corporation and/or gang) or to design and live in a small town that is aware of its role as a source of its resident's livelihood.&nbsp; Generate your own power, grow your own food, issue your own currency, all that.<br /><br />So, like Ron Paul people, but not wasting time running for office or complaining about the federal reserve, etc.&nbsp; He lays it out pretty simply: the interconnected markets of the world are a more reactive and complex system than any single government, or any coalition of governments that could form a practical coalition, and therefore, no government or coalition can control or re-direct it.&nbsp; So hang on tight for a swift descent into a new phase of...something!&nbsp; <br /><br />Dmitri Orlov wrote a book called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0865716064?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thatbriginst-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0865716064">Reinventing Collapse: The Soviet Example and American Prospects</a><img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=thatbriginst-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0865716064" style="border: medium none ! important; margin: 0px ! important;" width="1" /><br />, which is basically about what advice he, as a victim of the hollowing out and looting of the Soviet Government, can give to us, future survivors of the American Collapse.&nbsp; Yeah, he says it's already happening...well, yes, but he says people living in Russia at the time didn't see it coming either...well of course they tried to...now look, I don't see what my mother...FINE SURE I'M A COMMUNIST GET OVER IT.<br /><br />I should also say that this book came out in June of last year and has recently, shall we say, seen it's stock rise significantly.<br /><br />So, what these two sites have in common is<br /><ol><li>They are both shall we say <i>mildly pessimistic</i> about the chances many current economic and societal structures have for survival in the coming years, much less decades.&nbsp;</li><li>I frequently find them both to be hilarious.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ol>Don't get me wrong: I believe them.&nbsp; I've been convinced.&nbsp; It may not happen as fast or as bad as they say, but I rate many of their predictions as above 60% likely.&nbsp; But for all the bleakness and sadness I acknowledge I should be feeling, the idea, for example, that I might see in my lifetime the collapse of Northern Mexico <b>and parts of the Southern US </b>into narco-feudal warzones makes me completely giddy.&nbsp; I start giggling.&nbsp; Explanations of the expected hollowing out of nation-states make me guffaw.&nbsp; I couldn't help it, and for a while, I didn't even question it.<br /><br />Discussions with others (frequently started by me sharing a post in reader about, say, "international corporations successfully capturing vast state assets" with a note of, say, "HAW HAW") has gradually revealed to me that this is not a universal reaction.&nbsp; They find the concept of Black Swans - events that are about to happen for the first time and therefore cannot be predicted based on previously gathered data - quite frightening.&nbsp; And they should!&nbsp; It's going to be terrible!&nbsp; Swathes of people are going to die (elsewhere) or at best learn how to live on drastically reduced resources (here)!&nbsp; How can I laugh at that?<br /><br />But I do, so I was encouraged by people who I tried to share my mirth with to explain myself.<br /><br />I think my problem is that, having accepted predictions of <i>unavoidable</i> awfulness, I feel compelled to not let it effect me unproductively.&nbsp; The surprise of seeing things this way induces shock, and laughter is the noise we instinctively make when we are shocked <i>but rapidly become convinced that we aren't in immediate danger</i>, or that at the very least (it seems in my case) that we should try not to lose our heads just yet.<br /><br />I'd be afraid of the future if it were looming behind me as I type this, but as it is instead looming over the entire world, I accept that I have to roll with the punches. It's not that the situation is humorous; humor exploits the laughter response, rather than creating it.&nbsp; The situation is a communal threat that I respond to with a socially-focused quasi-distress call.&nbsp; I'm trying to be aware of what a global depression would require of me, and of all the steps I can to be ready for a collapse. <br /><br />But the very first thing that happens when I realize that the United States doesn't need to have a command economy to reliably produce "solutions" that just make things worse,&nbsp;is I start to laugh.&nbsp; It's not at anyone's expense; it's just in surprise at the sudden appearance of a serious challenge that's facing all of us.<br /><br />Part of the cause of this perception is that people of my age or younger, even in DC, seem to have a bias against talking too seriously with each other.&nbsp; Yes, the college I attended trained its young people to talk <i>endlessly</i> about <i>everything</i>, but even in my fellow students, I saw a push towards not being a downer, towards shared frivolity.<br /><br />And that's not bad.&nbsp; It's just that now, I feel more inclined to share my laughter with people than what comes in the silence afterwards, the fumbling strategic planning of a young person who doesn't have any sources of information on the subject except these two doom-sayers.<br /><br />Well, them and <a href="http://thomaspmbarnett.com/weblog/">Thomas P. Barnett</a>, author of (among others) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0399155376?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thatbriginst-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0399155376">Great Powers: America and the World After Bush</a><img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=thatbriginst-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0399155376" style="border: medium none ! important; margin: 0px ! important;" width="1" />, now available in better bookstores nationwide.&nbsp; His is the hopeful approach.<br /><br />I ended up putting all three of them in a folder informatively labeled "Future," and none in the folder labeled "Humor."<br /><br />-Nick<br /><br />PS: In other news, I'm still unemployed, but I remain unconcerned.&nbsp; So maybe I just have a dampened danger sense/anxiety response.&nbsp; But I don't think so.&nbsp; I hope to discuss why in a later post.
