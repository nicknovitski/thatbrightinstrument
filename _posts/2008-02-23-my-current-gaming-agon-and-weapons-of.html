It doesn't rain but that it pours: I have no ongoing games for nearly a year, and all of a sudden, two groups of three coalesce around two games I've been wanting to run for years.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.agon-rpg.com/"><span style="font-size: 130%;">AGON</span></a><br /><br />Cooperation is competition in this game of heroic greek adventure<span style="font-style: italic;"> </span>in the vein of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Odyssey</span>.  It's basically the Dungeons and Dragons formula made explicit: Gods give the players quests, they overcome the obstacles which the Moderator provides.  There's a budgeting system: Moderators get a pool of "strife," based on how long they've decided the quest should be and how many players there are, which is spent from to create challenges and enemies.  There's also a ranking system:  The characters are all "balanced" against one another, so that the players compete to achieve the maximum amount of glory before their hero either dies or is permitted to reach their home island.<br /><br />The players had played it with me once before, in a group of five, all of whom were playing for the first time, as was I.  The result then was an extremely slow and careful process.  I decided that this time, the mitts were off:  I spent over half my strife pool on a single NPC and his war-band.  The tempo and tenor of the battle changed as the group realized that, perhaps unlike in many other games, their survival depended on strategic use of their abilities.  Also, that I was trying to <span style="font-style: italic;">KILL</span> them.  We were interrupted by the limited hours of our dining hall, but even taking that into account, I think my pacing sucked.<br /><br />Perhaps it's just lack of familiarity, but I spent too much time looking things up, not finding them, hesitating, stumbling...Basically, I look forward to being able to feel that I'm getting better, but that day has not yet come.<br /><br />I also contend that the book is at least a little bit to blame, with sometimes less-than-optimal organization, and being rigidly specific on most things, while maddeningly vague on others (How do players neutralize Advantage dice?  Do you earn Glory when enemies surrender?  When they call for a truce?  If enemies get away from a battle alive, can their wounds be healed?)<br /><br />The game comes standard with a <a href="http://random-average.com/Agon/HomePage">wiki</a>, which has become a very popular support option for games lately, with good reason: It centralizes every good idea (and some meh ones) that people have had about the game.  Open-source for analog experiences!  We used the <a href="http://random-average.com/Agon/HeroicTraitConstructionKit">build-your-own Heroic Trait Option</a>, and that turned out fantastic.  I'll probably suggest we another similarly flexible generalization from the book's list of special maneuvers, <a href="http://random-average.com/Agon/Tricks">Combat Tricks</a>, as well as <a href="http://random-average.com/Agon/ModifiedRefreshment">Revised Refreshment</a> (something that the PCs need post-haste, after my delightful NPC got through with them) for variety and strategy.<br /><br />We aren't playing this week, due to a brief interruption in service (a player being visited by family), but next week will see the conclusion of one, perhaps two quests!<br /><a href="http://www.eos-press.com/products-wotg.html"><br /><span style="font-size: 130%;">Weapons of the Gods</span></a><br /><br />WotG ("wawt-guh," as I call it) is a game of wuxia action, intrigue and passion.  What's wuxia?  Well, wuxia movies are to kung fu movies what kung fu movies are to...well, more mundane films.  The radness-progression is something like:<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Mundane Fiction</span>: People fight.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Kung Fu Fiction</span>: People punch through walls and leap through the air.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Wuxia Fiction</span>: People fly, cut through steel, sound and light with magic sword, and coruscate with raw power when incensed.<br /><br />We haven't played yet: It's a new game to us all, and has several innovations which take even more accustoming to.    Hopefully, our next meeting will include the completion of standard character creation, and the move on to situation creation.<br /><br />WotG is a "big" game, which means that a group needs to somehow focus and direct the premise down to a manageable level.  If a game has a broad and varied setting, and characters have broad and varied capabilities, then you have to sit down and agree exactly what sort of things you'd like to do or see happen.  I will probably do that with my theme music system.<br /><br />There's also sometimes a need to give the players a context between their characters.  When I ran a game of <span style="font-style: italic;">Dogs in the Vineyard</span>, I told the players to explain their characters to each other, then asked them what their characters most and least liked about each other.  <span style="font-style: italic;">Dogs </span>is a game about what the players and their characters think should be done and the conflicts those judgments engender and conclude, so that worked; WotG is also about heroic brotherhood, so I might also steal a page from <span style="font-style: italic;">AGON</span>, which has the characters saving each other's lives before the game starts.<br /><br />A system for briefly narrating events that are explicitly happening "before the game starts" might be useful for any game.  Even <span style="font-style: italic;">The Shab-al Hiri Roach</span> starts with your character having a positive impression of the character of the player to your right, and a negative one of the player to your left, encouraging you to provide an explanation, and thus, a history.  In big and less focused games, it becomes even more helpful.  I believe I shall refer to such mechanics as "Issue Zero Systems," after the (admittedly ridiculous) practice of releasing a collector's issue before a comic is launched.<br /><br />We'll see how it works out tomorrow.<br /><br />-Nick
