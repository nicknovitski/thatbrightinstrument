Today, I complete my 25th year.  People (in my experience) often say, of useless things, "That and a quarter will buy you a cup of coffee."  Now, I have a quarter.  Does this obviate my uselessness?  Zhuang Zhe would probably comment that the qualities which make things 'useful' are rarely of benefit to them, and that such judgments are fraught with received and often incorrect opinion in any case.  Casting my innumerable regrets aside for one short moment, let me say that:<br /><ol><li>The beginning of my life is set and completed</li><li>It was quite nice, judging by the effects it had on me, compared to many less fortunate</li></ol>My belief in people (i.e., their actions) as functions of their environments/upbringings, dictates my reactions to them.  When interacting with someone who I see as partly responsible for 'how I turned out,' I remember just how much I am indebted and grateful to them; With all people in general, I try to act in such a way as they will have reason to be grateful to me, or (more likely) at least to have no reason to begrudge me.  The more deterministic we recognize human behavior to be, the more sensitive we should become in our dealings with others.  In this way, I can say that patent disbelief in the immortal soul and other nonsense has led me to ethical behaviors or, if you prefer, ethical nature.<br /><br />This might seem rather grandiose for a "Happy Birthday to me" post, but it was on my mind, and I have tried to make this blog an outlet only for what I would not be averse to everyone I ever meet having read.  Self-indulgence isn't really on the menu, unless it's swathed in judgmental platitudes like these.<br /><br />;)<br /><br />-Nick
