So I know that <a href="http://www.opensource.org/">Open Source</a> makes sense.  Blah blah blah, the <a href="http://catb.org/%7Eesr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/">Cathedral and the Bazaar</a>:  If our priorities are the quality of the software, then all evidence suggests that we should make viewing, changing and redistributing the source code of that software as easy as possible.  Those who argue otherwise have a differing priority, almost always personal wealth.<br /><br />But now consider the case of <a href="http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/">Dwarf Fortress</a>.  Made over more than a decade by a single developer (admittedly sometimes with the ideas of one other) pursuing his unique vision, the sole member of the non-existent "Fantasy World Simulator" genre, Dwarf Fortress is an astounding tribute to the power of ignoring what's possible, making the game you want to play, and general excellence.  Tarn Adams is a man of immense talent and dedication, and he's made something that, despite having graphics and interface like nothing you've ever seen (or, probably, ever wanted to), has rocked the digital gaming literati.  Considering its history, its uniqueness and process intensity, it might be the most incredible game any of us ever see.<br /><br />It's also unfinished.  It's in alpha, and has been since forever.  The <a href="http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/features.html">features list</a> beggars belief, but it's nothing compared to the <a href="http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/dev.html">development plan</a>.  Mr. Adams is in it for the long term.  Despite a rabid grass roots community springing up around it practically overnight, despite many cogent offers, he has not sold the game to a commercial developer or publisher, nor has he put it under an open source license.  To be clear:<br /><ol><li>Mr. Adams refuses to connect his game with any studio or publisher, because he worries he will lose control of his work; specifically, that he wouldn't be able to spend his time on the problems that personally interest him.<br /></li><li>Mr. Adams refuses to release his game under an open source license, because he worries he will lose control of his work; specifically, that he wouldn't ever be able to make money on his work.<br /></li></ol>You might accuse him of waffling, of being in truth only motivated, though not by greed, by instead a prickly selfishness: rather than wanting the software to improve like we do, he wants it to be <span style="font-style: italic;">his</span>. <br /><br />Playing Dwarf Fortress for any length of time gives you a easy analogy for his behavior.  Occasionally, you will receive a message that one of your craftsdwarves has taken a "fey mood."  If you're me, you'll be confused, and try to learn more.  All you'll find, though, is that they're muttering about a seemingly random series of substances, and hanging about by themselves.   In fact, they seem to be chasing out anyone who stumbles into their  workshop before resuming the difficult work of sitting in the middle of it, doing nothing.  Maybe you'll try getting some of these substances!  Maybe you'll fail to do so before their mood becomes less "fey" and more "murderous," and the nearest makeshift weapon becomes the doom of the ten or twelve hapless dwarves who first stumble within reach.  Maybe some guards will eventually put the frothing craftsdwarf down, or maybe, if you're me, the slaughter will continue until the raving murderer, festooned with the entrails of those he once called friend, stalks the empty, blood-soaked halls of your fortress, howling for onyx and anthracite, and you're forced to abandon the site and try to shake memories of what you witnessed.<br /><br />Let's go back a bit.  If you aren't me (or if you are, but are more prepared this time), you might have given the craftsdwarf what they wanted, which they would have greedily grabbed them and taken them back to the workshop.  A few days of strange noises later, they will emerge with something amazing.  It could be anything: a chalice, a shield, a spear, a ring, a robe, anything!  But it will inevitably be the most beautiful example of that kind of thing you've ever seen.  It will be worth a fortune.  It will be proof that the dwarves are descended from the First Maker and yet bear his legacy.  It will be the reason that those of the taller races speak of the halls of the dwarven forgers in tones of hushed awe.  It will be ornate, but invulnerable, gorgeous, yet functional, and it will almost certainly bear an image of some moment in the history of <span style="font-style: italic;">your fortress.  </span>It might be one of the high points in your history of playing the game: days, if not weeks, of wrestling with a new way of interpreting letters and symbols and a new system of key-strokes to manipulate them, and here, now, you have gotten something unexpectedly amazing out of it.<br /><br />Subtract my fannishness, and you might have how Mr. Adams sees the artistic process.  Or rather, the process of an artisan, which is undoubtedly what he is.  We don't ask a master violin-maker to out-source some of his method to interested volunteers, just so he can make his violins <span style="font-style: italic;">better</span>.  In fact, we don't even criticize him: if we know violins at all, we know the way the master makes them is beyond our judgment.  He invests himself in each part of it, he expresses himself through it.  It's like a painting that you can play.  It's made how it's made, and it's done when it's done.<br /><br />When I first looked at the problem, I thought I might be the calm and inviting voice that helped Mr. Adams see the sense in open source, but now, I'm less sure in my advocacy.  Are there, in fact, any advantages to open source for the artisan developer?<br /><br />-Nick
