I've reached that age: my friends are marrying.  This has prompted me to more fully explore and define my thoughts on marriage, much to the annoyance of some around me.  Which is a shame, because it always turns out that they are annoyed not at what I'm saying but at what some imaginary angry and foolish person is saying at the same time, sounding a lot like me.<br /><br />I hope I've learned enough from these mis-steps to avoid them now.<br /><br />For starters: When I talk about "marriage" below, I am only referring to the legal state, and not to any kind of ritual or ceremony your culture requires or encourages.<br /><br />Earlier this year, two freshmen were married in the halls of St. Johns.  It was a small ceremony, unattended by either family, or anyone at all except for the two themselves and a few friends.  It was performed by a tutor who may or may not be ordained.  It was, as far as the kids were concerned, a way of saying they love each other.  It was therefore equal parts adorable, hilarious and disturbing, but one thing that it wasn't?  Legally existent.  If they break up, unless a child is involved, she won't be able to pursue a claim on him.  If they earn enough money to file taxes this year, they can't file jointly.  Their ceremony, just like any other of any kind, not just marriage, has nothing to do with the law.  Our government does not recognize "unions made by God" or "life-sharing" or even "very special things between two people."  It recognizes "special tax status," and allows some pairs of people to file under it.<br /><br />To be clear: There's nothing wrong about your ceremony!  I'm sure it's very nice, and you can have it however and whenever you want!  Just don't let's talk about it right now, because I don't really have an opinion on it, except (just like every man sometimes thinks) that some of them are a huge waste of money.<br /><br />I hope that clears the path mentally for my thesis, which is...<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Marriage licenses and pre-nuptial agreements should be combined into a single thing, a customizable contract which governs the state of being legally married.</span><br /><br />Currently, marriage law is a hodgepodge.  Contracts, with requirements, terms, deadlines, conditions for release and breach, as well as penalties for the latter, will rectify this unsure and mutable situation.  By being required to sign and submit such a document, the parties will be encouraged to confront their opinions on what their marriage should actually entail: What they expect and require from themselves and each other.  Which is, I hope we'll all agree, something that people should do anyway.<br /><br />But maybe you don't agree.  Maybe you think this will discourage people from marrying, that if they thought about it more, they would do it less.  That's a frightening thing to believe.  Personally, I've seen lots of people only find the person they're truly happy with <span style="font-style: italic;">because</span> of thinking about it for a good while, and I suspect that if thinking about something discourages you from doing it, it probably wouldn't have worked out.  After all, you would have plenty of time to think about your marriage after you're married, so why not think about it now?  But this is all no doubt due to some "pro-thought" bias on my part. <br /><br />You may also think it unromantic.  That's a common accusation laid against the pre-nuptial agreement.  But it's not like the marriage license is any more romantic.  Neither of these documents have romance as their subject or goal: they just specify and regulate obligations.  I'm just trying to propose revisions in the law that would support making people happy.<br /><br />It's possible that you object to this valuing of the happiness of the participants over the continuity of the marriage.  There's no argument I can make against that:  I simply disagree, but that disagreement is based on postulates, not on reasons that can be persuaded away.  As far as I'm concerned, people and their feelings exist, but "relationships" and "marriages" do not exist, or at least, do not exist as separate from two people and the way they live and feel.  Marriages exist to support happiness, not the other way around, and if a marriage negatively effected your happiness, then it's without merit. <br /><br />I hope we can at least agree that our government should never take your position.  At best, it would be unconscionable interfering in people's private lives, and at worst, it would be completely against the constitution, which has nothing good to say about a "law respecting an establishment of religion."<br /><br />If, on the other hand, you have no objections to what I've said so far, then you agree that the law should support the reality and not the ideal.  In that case, you're ready for my favorite part: These contracts would have an term.  That is, when they were first written, the couple would choose a length of time (perhaps mostly between 7 and 20 years) which it would continue to be valid.  They could renew it any time they liked, but if they didn't both sign it again after the term expired, the marriage would also expire, without penalty.<br /><br />If you and your spouse agree that you never want to be able to leave your marriage without penalties, then obviously, you should renew early and often.  If you don't trust them to renew with you indefinitely, then you can try to convince them to make the term very long (though I would recommend reconsidering the whole thing).  In general, the length of your marriage should not be effected by this method: You still leave whenever you were going to leave, even if it's death.<br /><br />The point is, people shouldn't say "I'm married, therefore I should feel love," they should say "I feel love, therefore I'm married."  But that said, I know that feelings can be mercurial (boy howdy, do I know it), and it can be hard to tell whether it's a brief bad spell or an irreconcilable difference.  That's what the term is for: forcing you to think long-term.  You might have a tough period that lasts for a year or five, but you won't be able to leave without penalty unless, over the course of an <span style="font-style: italic;">entire term</span>, not <span style="font-style: italic;">once</span> did you feel good enough about your marriage to promise to stay another whole term.  And of course, in case it wasn't clear, if something happens that warrants breach (what exactly that would be depends on the couple, but infidelity, violence and sudden poorness are common causes today), then it would be immediately dissolved.<br /><br />The way I see it, people change, and no one should be punished forever for something the person they <span style="font-style: italic;">used to be</span> felt.  Marriages today are of finite duration, not because of some great degradation of morals this century, but because there isn't as much advantage to being married to one person for your whole life.  Even if you were able to turn back the clock to the better time, with shorter lifespans, drastically reduced social mobility, and brutal oppression of women, you'll never end divorce in practice.  However, with my proposal, you can make sure that the natural end of every marriage is as painless, manageable, and equitable as possible. <br /><br />In the end, my goal is that only people who want to be married are married.  Again, I'm pretty sure we can all agree on that.<br /><br />I feel uncomfortable appearing to tell people what to do, so lets assuage my ego-guilt by ending this with a question.<br /><br />On one hand, we have the fact that selection pressures favor polygyny, the common flavor of polygamy where men have multiple wives.  That is, polygynous societies have offspring of verifiably higher "fitness" in the evolutionary sense.  It's of clear benefit to men in general, since they have a chance to sow as many genetic oats as they can manage.  However, it's also of benefit to women, since it is more advantageous for them to have a fraction of the fittest mate, in the form of his genetic material and a little of his time and resources in raising the child, than to have the entirety of a less fit one.  In short, rich guys can keep lots of women and kids in a better lifestyle than poor guys can keep even one woman and their kids.<br /><br />Sensible.  I'm totally in favor of it.  Actually, because I'm a dirty liberal, I'm totally in favor of anyone being able to marry anyone they like, in whatever combination of gender and number.  The contract could easily have any number of people's names on it, or you could have separate contracts with.  As I remember, in the first episode of <span style="font-style: italic;">Star Trek: Enterprise</span> (the only one I have ever been able to sit all the way through), it's revealed that the ship's alien doctor has seven wives, who themselves each have seven husbands, of which he is only one (no doubt they were all <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_I_Was_Going_to_St_Ives">on their way to St. Ives</a>).  Someone expresses astonishment at this.  Thinking a moment, the doctor responds smiling that, while it might get a little confusing, he wouldn't have it any other way.  And certainly, if I ever heard of such a structure in the real world, I would laugh, but if it was consensual and happy, then I wouldn't have it any other way.  Let all those who can sign contracts (I.E., unimpaired humans who have reached their majority), do so in whatever combination they like!<br /><br />Of course, the tax law wouldn't support it.  And, what's more important, people would frequently insist that their contract preclude any others.  So the more complex structures would be difficult, though polygamy, and especially polygyny, would be within easy reach.  Hooray!<br /><br />But there's a problem with my rosy picture, and it's that polygny in modern industrial societies causes the formation of cultural institutions that encourage violence in general, and violence to women in particular.  If, say, the richer 50% of men have an average of two wives each, and those wives are happy and content with their position (as the above establishes they probably would be), then that leaves the other half (which include disproportionate numbers of young people) zero possible mates.  Young dudes with neither mates nor the reasonable prospect of mates are much more likely to take life-threatening risks, and to be murderously violent.  See, for one of the best examples, the young and unmarried jihadis and suicide bombers of Saudi Arabia, et al.<br /><br />So, what's the resolution?  Do we let the successful enjoy the fruits of their labor (and priviledged birth), or do we try to minimize as much as possible the radicalization of our youth and underclass? <br /><br />-Nick
