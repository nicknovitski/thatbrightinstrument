<a href="http://cluborlov.blogspot.com/2009/02/social-collapse-best-practices.html">Via ClubOrlov: Social Collapse Best Practices</a>:<br /><blockquote>Right now the Washington economic stimulus team is putting on their Scuba gear and diving down to the engine room to try to invent a way to get a diesel engine to run on seawater. They spoke of change, but in reality they are terrified of change and want to cling with all their might to the status quo. But this game will soon be over, and they don’t have any idea what to do next.<br /><br />So, what is there for them to do? Forget “growth,” forget “jobs,” forget “financial stability.” What should their realistic new objectives be? Well, here they are: food, shelter, transportation, and security. Their task is to find a way to provide all of these necessities on an emergency basis, in absence of a functioning economy, with commerce at a standstill, with little or no access to imports, and to make them available to a population that is largely penniless.</blockquote><br />Since finishing <span style="font-style: italic;">Shock Doctrine</span>, I've split my reading between <span style="font-style: italic;">Pantagruel</span> and this transcript of an address Dmitri Orlov gave to the Long Now Foundation.<br /><br />I don't own Orlov's book yet, to my mild distress, but I feel reassured that this speech is a reiteration of the advice his book contains, and thus can serve as a free, low-calorie book-substitute.  It's light, with wit and verve, but flavorful and sustaining, with wisdom and predictions.  Cassandra is mentioned.<br /><br />It struck me today today that Collapse theory, whatever its other virtues, can never be fit onto a bumper sticker.  "My other car is our country's rotting infrastructure"?  "Mule-riding Republican"?  "My child is an honor student at the Farming and Self-Defense Institute of Life"?<br /><br />-Nick
