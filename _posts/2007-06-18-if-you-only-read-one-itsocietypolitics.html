...it should be Google's recently made-public <a href="http://googlepublicpolicy.blogspot.com/">Public Policy blog</a>.  Sure it's Google-focused, but it's also straightforward, honest, and easy to understand.  Reading it will make you better-informed, and thereby better-equipped to prosecute your opinions on the country.<br /><br />Too many friends I try to talk to about <a href="http://googlepublicpolicy.blogspot.com/2007/06/what-do-we-mean-by-net-neutrality.html">Net Neutrality</a> or <a href="http://googlepublicpolicy.blogspot.com/2007/05/using-auctions-to-make-better-use-of.html">Spectrum Auctions</a> or <a href="http://googlepublicpolicy.blogspot.com/2007/05/keeping-google-and-america-competitive.html">H-1B Visas</a> escape their democratic responsibility to seek, hold and act on an opinion by not merely claiming ignorance, but acting to preserve that ignorance.  I think that this is only one step above the people who avoid reading short and simple accounts of the evidence for evolution and climate change for fear they'll understand them sufficiently to change their received opinions.<br /><br />Speaking of which, I also have friends who are not comfortable with Google's positioning in our information economy.  I'm not going to try to argue them into feeling differently (any more), but I will say that this site looks like it will still be of interest and use, given that it will contain honest, public declarations of their position on a variety of subjects.<br /><br />-Nick
