As of this post's appearance, my flight to Anaheim (i.e., Los Angeles) is scheduled to have left Ronald Reagan National Airport.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.americandigest.org/mt-archives/President%20Ronald%20Reagan.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://www.americandigest.org/mt-archives/President%20Ronald%20Reagan.jpg" width="159" /></a></div><br /><br />I like travel.&nbsp; I like going places.&nbsp; Driving is relaxing, untaxing and generally fun.&nbsp; So traveling on a plane, when you don't have to waste even that tiny fraction of your brain's processing power required to regulate a car's motion, must be even more relaxing!<br /><br />You expect me to be kidding, but it is, mostly.&nbsp; I find heights above twenty feet too abstract to be frightening.&nbsp; Though being six-feet-plus makes me even more generally uncomfortable on a plane than you average folks are, with every ceiling too low, with no aspect of the seat in the right place to support any of my bits what need supporting...I still go to sleep just the same.&nbsp; It's just discomfort, it's just time.&nbsp; Babies cry, folks cough and sneeze...but that's all normal.&nbsp; I share an atmosphere with you people anywhere I go.&nbsp; And in any case, I've had my cold for the year.<br /><br />And reaching and being in a different place, especially places that I've never been before, is always nice. &nbsp;Maybe this comes from growing up in Miami, where every building, road, tree and bird seemed just so slightly inimical to human life, like we weren't supposed to stay there too long or it would be our own damn fault what happened to us. &nbsp;DC is different, with folks of terrifying stability living without qualms for however long it takes, apparently waiting for this whole "federal government" fad to pass.<br /><br />You might guess that I miss California, so it's lucky that's&nbsp;where I'm going! &nbsp;<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;q=anaheim,+ca&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;t=h&amp;z=11&amp;iwloc=addr">Anaheim</a>&nbsp;, specifically, via John Wayne Airport.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.blackhillsportal.com/dbs/bellefourchechamber/files/Image/john_wayne_art.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="164" src="http://www.blackhillsportal.com/dbs/bellefourchechamber/files/Image/john_wayne_art.jpg" width="200" /></a></div><br />(To confirm: taking off at Reagan, landing at John Wayne.)<br /><br />Besides the weather and culture, I have the further double-treat of staying with a friend who I haven't spent real time with in several years, and getting to go to <a href="http://www.blizzcon.com/">Blizzcon</a>&nbsp;.<br /><br />You don't know my friend, or you'd be happy for just that reason, but you might have heard of the annual "fan convention" put on by <a href="http://www.blizzard.com/">Blizzard Entertainment</a>, makers of World of Warcraft and other Very Good Games.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://wow.mmolecule.com/articles/ektimages/game/wow/blizzcon_small.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="166" src="http://wow.mmolecule.com/articles/ektimages/game/wow/blizzcon_small.jpg" width="200" /></a><a href="http://www.errant-notions.net/Images/Blizzcon/Boomkin.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://www.errant-notions.net/Images/Blizzcon/Boomkin.jpg" width="132" /></a></div><br /><br />And even if I wasn't going to someplace I knew could be fun, I would know that I'd be fine. &nbsp;I have this strange tendency to not remember any place or routine except the one I am currently inside of. &nbsp;Confrontation with simultaneous evidence of different epochs at the same time (say, when I leave work on Friday and go to visit the college campus in Annapolis) makes me queasy; maybe it's a function of my generally poor memory, maybe I just want changes to stay changed, so my bizarre fluidity remains an advantage, but either way, I get the opposite of homesickness, which is what the word "homesickness" should actually mean anyway. &nbsp;If I start &nbsp;talking about "milksickness" or "bonesickness," you don't think that I am longing for those things, you think they have some kind of problem and I need to either avoid them or fix them! &nbsp;And what's with all this looking back in the first place? &nbsp;The future, the things that come next, those things are awesome, right?<br /><br />That those words are a half-lie, coming from me, might be why every night before I travel farther than an hour and a half, I get so nervous I can't sleep. &nbsp;I might punch and kick things, throw stuff around with strangled shouts. &nbsp;I might suddenly decide to take back up running, and leave at 10 to come back at midnight. &nbsp;I might decide to start driving, just pick a road and keep going until either it runs out, or I do.<br /><br />I don't really know why this happens, but maybe it's because I am instinctively afraid of some potential loss. &nbsp;It's so easy for me to become someone else somewhere else that whoever I am before I leave senses his death approaching.<br /><br />We all die gradually, again and again, until we stop. &nbsp;Each day a slightly different person wakes up in our bed than did the day before (meaning ourselves, and not counting other reasons for multiple folks passing through our beds, but if the distinction is necessary, then more power to you) until no one wakes up at all. &nbsp;I guess more solid personalities are selected for on one level: if one mode of being is more likely to persist, then it's more likely for more folks to be in that mode at any given time. &nbsp;I like to think that there are advantages to this flexibility, this identi-facility, but it's obvious that's only because I'm stuck with it. &nbsp;Permanence has its appeal.<br /><br />I'm glad to have company on this particular night before. &nbsp;It helps a small bit; at least I'm not at great risk of hurting myself.<br /><br />-Nick
