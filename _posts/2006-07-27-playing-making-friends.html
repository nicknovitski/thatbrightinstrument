<a href="http://www.next-gen.biz/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&amp;amp;id=3518&Itemid=2">Next Generation - Can Games Make You Cry?</a><br /><br />Fan-TAS-tic article.  Go read!  Shoo!<br /><blockquote><br />Every medium we devise is a study of certain properties in the world around us, manipulated to express meaning based on our existing understanding of the underlying principles of that medium...<br /><br />The purpose of all of these media is to use their innate representational abstractions – abstractions that are, in their primary form, essentially familiar to us – to weave even greater, more sophisticated metaphor that, in an idealized case, plays upon the very nature of the medium at hand to express ideas and emotions that would be impossible to otherwise similarly express.</blockquote>Woo!  Fancy words!<br /><br />It seems clear that the group play medium lends itself to metaphors of society.  This would mean that the artistic strength of rpgs lies in sympathetic interactions with other<br />humans.<br /><br />Which is cool.
