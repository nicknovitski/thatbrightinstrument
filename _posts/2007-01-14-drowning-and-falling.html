One of my new year's resolutions that I expect to keep was to post write-ups of the two games that I played last fall that I never talked about here.  Inspired by <a href="http://www.somethingawful.com/articles.php?a=4394">Steve's Character Guide</a>, I'll do<a href="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/games/index.php?game=drowning_and_falling"> Drowning and Falling</a> first.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/games/index.php?game=drowning_and_falling">Drowning and Falling</a> is kinda like <a href="http://www.sjgames.com/munchkin/game/">Munchkin</a>; the various tropes of 'classic' fantasy rpgs are amped to 11, and you die a lot.  Here's the tale of our doughty adventuring band:<br /><br />On the way to the dungeon, it began to rain.  As we walked down the muddy, potholed road, a pack of jeering children began hurling rocks at us.  Not three feet into the dungeon, a narrow strip of the 10'x10' corridor dropped about six inches, tripping us and barking us on the knee.  At the end of a rollicking minecart ride, we were ejected toward a target painted on a suspiciously stained rock wall.  We woke up in an orc tribe's village, where they made us partake in their manhood ritual; We had to run over a series of rolling logs  suspended  above a pond of discusting orc water.  After escaping, we encountered evidence of Intelligent But Tired Design, when a bridgekeeper tried to keep us from crossing a bridge over...the ground.  Tired from our travails, we rested the night in a spooky mansion on a dark hilltop, and were amazed when the entire building started spinning us like bingo balls!  We traveled through the bog of eternal stench (of <span style="font-style: italic;">Labyrinth </span>fame) and were attacked by a stinky minotaur.  Finally reaching the dungeon again, the doorbell at the side entrance caused the gargoyles overhead to vomit a torrent of boiling pitch at us.  Hacking our way past this obstacle, we came to a broad canyon with a cannon on our side and a depressingly thin twin mattress on the other.  Finally, at the heart of the dungeon, we found a simple barrel of water with some apples bobbing on the surface...WHICH TURNED OUT TO BE A LEVEL 30 APPLE BOBBING BARREL MIMIC!<br /><br />It was a long slog and a tough battle.  We lost a lot of good men, but in the end, with such awesome challenges, monsters, and of course, a huge pile of treasure, everyone was a winner.  Two thumbs way up.
