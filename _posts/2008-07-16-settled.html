As of today, I have been at my new job for one week, and in my new apartment for two.<br /><br />The apartment is great.&nbsp; Besides living with my good-friend-for-years Daniel, I also enjoy that it is:<br /><ul><li>Capacious, such that all of my crap can be placed to hand or out of the way as I choose (though, for some of it, I haven't gotten around to choosing yet), and so we can easily entertain.</li><li>Elevated, such that the sun wakes me rather than the garbage truck, and downtown is laid out beneath me.</li><li>Full-featured, with a gym and pool, situated near one another for obvious synergistic effect.</li><li>Centrally located, a moments walk away from parking, grocery stores, a pharmacy, banks, a book store, a comic book store, and enough restaurants to last for several lifetimes. </li></ul>My share of the rent is twice what it was for the last apartment.&nbsp; But besides what I've mentioned already, the new one has an extra bathroom, and utilities are included.&nbsp; It also has a deck, which lacks only deck chairs and a table on which to rest your mai tai or mimosa before it becomes the greatest decadence I've ever had in my living situation. <br /><br />And of course, being in the Washington Metropolitan area means getting Washington Metropolitan work.<br /><br />The job is in Georgetown, about 45 minutes away from my front door, including walking to the elevator, taking the elevator, walking to the metro, taking the metro, walking to the bus stop, taking the bus, and walking to the building.&nbsp; This is a more-than-manageable commute, for those who don't know.&nbsp; Riding the metro for an hour is vastly more relaxing than driving for an hour.&nbsp; I read, I rest my eyes, it's great. <br /><br />I'm a junior developer at a web design firm, which means I (and a slight majority of the company's staff) spend most of my time making changes and fixes to the websites of customers.  This work is of surprising variety, as the customers have all kinds of needs and set-ups.  It seems like there's always something new to learn and do, except when there isn't.<br /><br />It's regulated without being regimented; our system for automatically tracking client requests and projects also tracks the time we claim that we spent on them, with the goal being all fourty hours of your week being accounted for.&nbsp; But that's hardly a burden when surroundings are comfortable, co-workers are welcoming, and work is diverting.<br /><br />In general, it's all that I deserve.<br /><br />-Nick
