It was a maze on a maze on a maze, level after level of briar and weathered stone and iron grate.  Parts of it had collapsed, and we were climbing out of just such a section onto the top level.  It was surrounded by unnecessarily tall walls (a two-foot hedge would have served the same purpose), and the size of three or four football fields.<br /><br />We ran across the ruined surface towards the only doors, again, imposingly huge.  They swung open as we approached, but we still had to cross the opulent, incongruously well-kept period antechamber to reach the outer doors.<br /><br />The clock chimed, the bells tolled, the doors would not open.  I allowed myself only a moments regret.  I cast the three greatest treasures I had found on this trip (only the latest of many, but the first which had ended this way, though I of course knew the risks) to the floor in front of me, and I adopted a suitably humble posture from which I might hope to beg for my life.  I urged you to do the same.  It would be a shame if the master of this place were to kill you before our sentence ran 0ut, and that was the great hope which now consumed me: if we could serve for one year without bringing fatal wrath on our heads, then we could return to our homes, our lives...<br /><br />Enough, he was coming.  I cleared my thoughts of such things.  When next the gates opened, only an hour would have passed.  All would be as we left it.  Only we would be changed and...I cleared my thoughts of such things.<br /><br />-Nick
