<blockquote>Most roleplaying games are designed with cheaters, wankers and munchkins in mind. Designers put in place to keep those people from abusing loopholes. After all, this is a roleplaying game. Loopholes exist. So, instead of putting so many limits on the players that they can’t even breathe, I’ve done the opposite. I’ve put the power directly into your hands. Again, you may ask, why would I do such a thing?<br /><br />Because I trust you.<br /><br />I trust that you understand it isn’t just the Narrator’s job to make sure everybody’s having fun. It’s <i>everybody’s</i> job to make sure everybody is having fun. </blockquote><br />That was John Wick, creator of the roleplaying games <i>Legend of the Five Rings</i> and <i>7th Sea</i>, from the "Players" chapter of his brand new roleplaying game, <i>Houses of the Blooded</i>.&nbsp; So now that you've met him, maybe now you understand me when I say that, when John Wick tells you that for a limited time only, you can <a href="http://wickedthought.livejournal.com/777693.html">get the pdf of his brand new roleplaying game<i>, Houses of the Blooded</i>, for only five stinkin' bucks</a>, then you don't think about it, you <a href="http://www.indiepressrevolution.com/xcart/product.php?productid=16617">buy the damn thing</a>.<br /><br />And by you, I mean "I and maybe you too."<br /><br />From my skimming once-over, it's excellent.&nbsp; It's <i>Vampire</i> meets <i>Birthright</i>.&nbsp; Or at least, it's the meeting of what I wanted those games to be.&nbsp; Rules for personal passion and tragedy, rules for managing and expanding your holdings.&nbsp; I deem it to be "the hype."<br /><br />The core innovation on top of the Fate system is the concept of "wagers."&nbsp; Simply:<br /><ol><li>Get dice (6-sided) from one stat and some aspects.</li><li>Choose how many of those dice you roll, and how many you instead "wager".</li><li>Sum results of rolled dice.&nbsp; Greater than 10 is "success".&nbsp; Say how you do or do not accomplish (your choice) what was being tested.</li><li>If you succeeded, state one more fact about the action for each wager you made.<br /></li></ol>Basically, the camera rests on characters when they are doing what they are good at.&nbsp; Also, it explicitly turns "Gather Information" rolls into "Establish as Fact Whatever You Think Would Be Advantageous or Cool" rolls.&nbsp; Awesome.<br /><br />No list of skills means ability in a given field (there are six) is broadly applicable, so characters (presumably) feel extremely capable.&nbsp; But they also have a weakness, which is nearly absolute; you receive no dice in one of the six kinds of rolls.&nbsp; Other games talk about "tragic flaws," but this one cuts a hole in your armor and rings the dinner bell for your enemies.<br /><br />Yet another game to file under "Would Like to Play Sometime."&nbsp; Sigh.<br /><br />-Nick
