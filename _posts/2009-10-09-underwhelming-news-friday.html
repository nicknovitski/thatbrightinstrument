NPR is my morning alarm, so I woke up to hear that Barack Obama had won the Nobel Peace Prize. &nbsp;Color me lunatic fringe, but I'm not sure that continuations of the Bush detention, torture and secrecy policies quite puts you on the same level as Jimmy Carter, Nelson Mandela and Mother Teresa. &nbsp;"Thank You for Not Being Bush, Cries Grateful World."<br />Then I watched the live feed of the <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/LCROSS/main/index.html">LCROSS impact</a>, but the Centaur module sent up no visible flash or plume at all. &nbsp;What a gyp! &nbsp;Hearing the NASA commentators backpedal was a bit amusing, though. &nbsp;Hopefully the LCROSS itself will be a bigger boom, and the spectroscopic analysis will be positive.<br /><br />In good new, though, IaWA was great fun last night. &nbsp;Jila (my character since session 1, who will almost certainly not be part of #2) was abused - as depressingly usual...be aware what you're getting into for playing a character both feminine and child-like in a game of brutal Conan-ery, with all-male players - but then had one of those abusers skinned (okay, it was a living statue, but it still hurt), and then (sadly) strangled the other personally. &nbsp;I suspect that was the first time she had ever killed someone "up close," and if we ever play out subsequent events, she will be much changed.
