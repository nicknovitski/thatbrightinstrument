I watched this the other day.<br /><br /><object height="344" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/DlNCQyZB7JQ&hl=en&fs=1&rel=0&color1=0x006699&color2=0x54abd6"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/DlNCQyZB7JQ&hl=en&fs=1&rel=0&color1=0x006699&color2=0x54abd6" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object><br /><br />By which I mean, I watched the pilot episode.  The series wasn't picked up, and the odds of the pilot alone seeing a television or DVD release in America are exceedingly slim.  So what I'm saying is you have few reasons not to download the silly thing. <br /><br />The show was to be based on the ideas of Jaime Hewlett, he of <a href="http://www.tank-girl.com/">Tank Girl</a> and <a href="http://www.gorillaz.com/flash.html">Gorillaz</a> fame, and I think it shows.<br /><br />Terry Phoo is a cop from Hong Kong with a cool car and no investigative skills whose kato mask seems to be an actual part of his body, and who is sent to England to help catch the people who killed the Queen, and also to transport Buddha's Loincloth, a sacred relic of unclear purpose.&nbsp; In London, he encounters Whitey Action, the ambiguously-aged free-spirited red-banged daughter of the over-protective abrasively-expat-American police chief who invited Terry's assitance (you'd hope that would make him Chief Action, but unfortunately, he's named Ben Benson).<br /><br />(Oh, and he's played by Carl Weathers.)<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://img.search.com/thumb/8/81/Carl_Weathers.jpg/180px-Carl_Weathers.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://img.search.com/thumb/8/81/Carl_Weathers.jpg/180px-Carl_Weathers.jpg" width="160" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.sfgate.com/blogs/images/sfgate/parenting/2007/11/07/apollopic.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="183" src="http://www.sfgate.com/blogs/images/sfgate/parenting/2007/11/07/apollopic.jpg" width="200" /></a></div><br />(Yeesh.&nbsp; Someone get that man a lead role.&nbsp; Or at least a supporting role that isn't comically racist.&nbsp; At least in this, he named his daughter "Whitey".)<br /><br />Anyway, Whitey thinks she can help solve the case, especially since she knows who did it (The Freebies, a gang of vicious mutants who are also beloved television personalities), and what they're planning next (kidnapping the two now-somewhat-grownup princes, who might have the funniest portrayals in the show, and this when one of the villains has a basketball for a head).&nbsp; Terry decides to trust her, especially when it's revealed that she, as the chosen one, can wear and use the Buddha's Loincloth.&nbsp; Buddha, you see, used it to create the universe, so while Whitey wears them (they look like athletic shorts/hot pants), she can pull anything she wants out of her crotch. Giant chocolate eggs.&nbsp; Tracking devices.&nbsp; Tranquilizer guns.&nbsp; <br /><br />So as far as I'm concerned, it was an entertaining idea with an amusingly-detailed execution (Terry's hair, Whitey's friend, Benson's dislike of clothing, everyone's slang and turns of phrase), and I recommend it.&nbsp; At the very least, I think you should watch it for the sake of having an opinion: whether it's your new fave or not, it's challenging and non-standard television, which I think we can all agree is <i>the best kind</i>.<br /><br />Well, maybe we can't all agree.&nbsp; Speaking only for myself, TV sucks, meaning I don't rate much of it very high on my aesthetic scales.&nbsp; But that's not too surprising, because in the business of television I, as a viewer, am not the customer, but the product; purchasers of advertising are the customers, and they want the assurance that their message will reach the demographic their marketing studies have told them are most <strike>vulnerable</strike> open to their message.&nbsp;<br /><br />So I have a television set, but no cable, satellelite or antenna; I use only occasionally, and only for watching dvds and playing video games.&nbsp; It seems to me that if a piece of entertainment appeals to me enough that I think the creators deserve to be rewarded, even at a cost of $20-$50 to me, then I buy it.&nbsp; If it seems to be worth less than that, then I torrent it and see what I think.<br /><br />Harsh, right?&nbsp; Actually, if there was some easier way of giving money directly to the people I think deserve to be rewarded, then I wouldn't bother buying a physical dvd ever again.&nbsp; God only knows how much of the purchase price is wasted on manufacture, distribution, "licensing" and other bullshit I don't care about, but however much is left over would probably be seem a much more reasonable price to be able to give to only the artists and technicians who made it.&nbsp; Why should I give any money to support distribution networks and trade-protection gangs that add no value to the work and that are looking less and less likely to survive with my cash or without it?<br /><br />I suppose it could be worse: in Great Britain, they're thinking about taxing every Internet service provider as much as $40 per year per broadband connection to create a fund that would pay out to the music and movie industry.&nbsp; Which would actually be great, if only in return, as with the typical laws concerning radio stations, that excepted the ISPs from having any other copyright-related claim pursued against them.&nbsp; But instead, it's just an attempted kneecapping of a flourishing business model in order to inflate a dying one.<br /><br />And I certainly include in that any resale or rental outlets (Ebay, Netflix, etc).&nbsp; Not a single cent of the money you spend at them goes to the original artist, so they're black holes as far as I'm concerned.&nbsp; If you want to save money (and money has certainly become more dear to us all, lately), then do the smart thing and don't spend any of it.<br /><br />Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to put all my old DVDs on Craigslist. &nbsp; <br /><br />-Nick
