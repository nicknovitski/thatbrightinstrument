T-Mobile has announced that it will be releasing the world's first phone running the <a href="http://code.google.com/android/">Android</a> OS/framework/standard/stack, the <a href="http://www.t-mobileg1.com/default.aspx">T-Mobile G1</a>.&nbsp; I think they missed an opportunity to call it <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyqGlpGCSho">Torg</a>.&nbsp; <br /><br />It will be released October 22nd, priced $179 with a two-year contract, unlimited data for $25 a month, and will be five thousand times sexier than the iPhone, for a bunch of mundane reasons, at the heart of which lies the simple fact: you own it and can change it and add to it and make it into exactly the device that you want, and Google will help you do it.&nbsp;<br /><br />I would buy it in a second, but it requires a 3G network, and T-Mobile has yet to start one in DC.<br /><br />But!&nbsp; Of course, if a way arose to "jailbreak" the phone, meaning that I could use it with a plan from Verizon, who does offer local 3G...<br /><br />...then I could spend a bunch of money on something super-amazingly-awesome I don't need.&nbsp; Best to take any excuse to wait and see how it all turns out.&nbsp; I am following Android's progress with exceedingly keen interest.&nbsp; I suspect it's going to graduallly and gently knock the iPhone onto its candy ass.<br /><br />-Nick
