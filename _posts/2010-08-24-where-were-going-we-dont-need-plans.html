I jokingly told my mother on Sunday, while we were driving from Dutch Flat (look it up) to San Francisco, that I would have to make a blog post with this title soon. &nbsp;I even explained the joke, since she hadn't seen or didn't remember seeing <i>Back to the Future</i>. &nbsp;I further explained what it meant to me personally, though she more or less understood that part, since it was the context the subject had come up: I wanted fewer things tying me to a particular place, to a particular job. &nbsp;I'm selling most of what I own so that I can more effectively bum about for a while. &nbsp;This shocks her, child of a more enlightened time.<br /><br />Anyway, today <b>she (my mother) is unconscious in a hospital</b>, so to anyone who reads this who I had made some kind of plans with: sorry, <b>the deal's off, the flight's canceled</b>, etc etc.<br /><br />I try not to let personal tragedies shape my perception of the wider world, but I can't help typing "We are living in the post-plan era."
