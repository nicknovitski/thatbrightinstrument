<a href="http://burningempires.com/">Burning Empires</a> rocks on toast, in my humble opinion.  This has been the case since I first heard of it.  Now, however, that opinion is based on experience.<br /><br />I ran a game.  Just one session of something designed to go on much longer, but I definitely got the idea.  First, the players made the world, <a href="http://www.burningempires.com/wiki/index.php?title=Iram">Iram</a>.  Then we <a href="http://www.burningempires.com/wiki/index.php?title=Vox_Populi_Vox_Dei">played</a>. <br /><br />Rocks.  On.  Toast.<br /><br />Daniel said some wonderful things about it on the mailing list.<br /><blockquote>I'll begin by saying I liked the game enough to dish out $45 to buy it.  This being capitalist-America and all, that is likely the strongest endorsement that is most easily understood by the largest amount of people.</blockquote>Okay, so that wasn't really one of the wonderful things.  So sue me.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/games/index.php?game=roach">The Roach</a> is next!
