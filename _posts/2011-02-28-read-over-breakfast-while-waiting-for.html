<blockquote>I have a nice but <strong>small studio</strong> in the tenderloin. It is $625 a month with electric included. With dsl and cable it will be about <strong>$700 a month which means about $350 each</strong>. The only interior door is on the bathroom. It has a full kitchen and large refrigerator. There are two separate rooms and <strong>maybe a curtain could be put up</strong> for some privacy but <strong>the way to the bathroom is through one room and the way to the kitchen is through the other room</strong>. It has ten foot ceilings so it is possible to build loft beds but right now e way to the kitchen is through the other room. h the other room. It has ten foot ceilings so it is possible to build loft beds but <strong>right now I have no furniture</strong>. This will be a cramped living situation where the only real upside is that it is ridiculously inexpensive. It is a low income building so you must have a <strong>documented income less than 17,000 a year</strong>. </blockquote><br />I almost want to email this guy just to see if we can ever hang out.<br /><br />San Francisco~!
