Hours have passed by unnoticed as I read with keen joy the paperback I purchased reflexively in the five-hour wait of BWI.  Upon finishing, immensely pleased by my savvy choice (<span style="font-style: italic;">Accelerando</span>, and I highly reccomend it), framed by:<br /><ul><li>The two-dimensional rendering of interlocking four-dimensional white and blue pyramids (American's upholstery of choice) and</li><li>The soft brown hair of she who has the window seat, whose profile, when she permits me to see it, grants me almost almost as thin and relaxed a pleasure as the book does,<br /></li></ul>I see, in turn (though in an increment of time I am not equipped to distinguish from spontaneity), two things out the airplane window.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">First</span>: A ribbon of bland concrete brackteted by dark, irregular brush, itself further bracketed by square-edged milk-blue lakes, on the edges of which...<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Then</span>: My eyes saccade and I am now <span style="font-style: italic;">there</span>, upon that abandoned, misbegotten un-road, bleached and smoothed by the late afternoon sun, reflecting and expelling what heat as it can up in direct lasers into me or indirect thermals gusts around me, such that I feel I am surrounded by the great damp ghost of a half-smothered fire, the sensation of which overrides what heat the sun would seem to provide, except I value my retinas and try to shield them as best I can from the explosions of light that come from all angles, from the water, stewing the tailings of the limestone gravel pit that it once was, in that time of Miami's last (only) export industry, from the unconcerned story-and-a-half-tall warehouse parks, from the things which grow which I am expected to call "trees," from the plane above me.<br /><br />Then, of course, a moment of self-conscious reflection.  Embarrassment, because I never tire of telling those who don't know what a terrible place Miami is, how it attracts those who have no reason to value the place they live, how the worst of them, the grasping thieving minority, fill the halls of power, and how the worst of them, the ignorant hateful majority, permit it. How it smells bad enough that now I have no sense of smell.  How it is a short-sighted, bawling idiot of a place.  Embarrassment, because faster than I am able to perceive, I found myself imagining and understanding my place in it, found myself <span style="font-style: italic;">there</span> before I had to be, in a place which I had neither anticipated nor feared nor truly spared a thought for at all, despite deciding to travel there again, after so long.<br /><br />Embarrassment frequently comes to me in the form of this question (which I assiduously attempt to answer): How is it that I permitted this thing to occur?  In this case: What caused/enabled this experience?<br /><br />It was as close as I have come to an <span style="font-style: italic;">artistic</span> experience.  I sensed without sensing.  I reacted emotionally to a painting I had not painted (and could not paint, of course, I hasten to add).  It got my creative blood up.  On the plane, paperless, I began composing what you read.  Upon landing and having dinner with my mother and father, I was feuertrunken, speaking too loud, too quick, about all the things which I necessarily had planned for the coming school year.  I knew what part of <span style="font-style: italic;">War and Peace</span> I was going to write my Senior essay on, I knew I needed a laptop to use my spare time to finish the PHP/MySQL/Javascript project so I could use it as a resume to find a job (seeking a good <span style="font-style: italic;">project</span> rather than a good <span style="font-style: italic;">company</span>, I explained in detail).  Yesterday, I suddenly had, for the first time, an idea for a short story that is <span style="font-style: italic;">finite</span> in scope, that I have a hope of finishing.  Art?  Inspiration is the more timid word for it.  I say that art is not an artifact, but a feeling.  "This" substantive thing is never art, though when standing before a thing (in a museum or before a sunset or on a dance floor) which causes you to thrill in ways not easily reducible, you might very well, your head swimming with minute semi-vertigo, the bottom having dropped out under your diaphragm, your every muscle except the one behind your eyes relaxing, breathe:<br /><br />"Ah, Art!"<br /><br />This happens too, even in Miami, that ugliest duckling, that fevered coke-fiend, that tanned, manicured snake-oil salesman.  But where does it come from? The percolating echoes of all the latin-american theologico-political failures, writ in nightmarishly lurid colors across the broken, jagged canvas of a city that was never good for anything good? The equatorial physics which give us cleansing (but oppressive) rain, clear (though choking) air and an egg-greenish-white sun, combining to result in a quality of light that makes the colors seem to not merely "pop," but leap from their emitters and seek to batter you to the ground, screaming imprecations in their spectrum band?<br /><br />I know the answer.  I should point out that this answer is neccessarily (from my working definition of art) personal.  I will explain it.<br /><br />The high-and-junior-high school I attended, serving the bugaboo of parent donations, hoping to provide students which corresponded to the college admissions junta's latest buzzwords, first set me on the conscious path of "well-rounded education."  We studied a language a week for almost a full year.  We ignited reactive metals.  We shot targets full of arrows.  We disected living objects.  And naturally, we were sent to an "art class."<br /><br />What did we do there?  All I can remember are the perspective studies.  Take two points on the equator of a large sheet of paper, and remember that surfaces which recede into the distance (<span style="font-style: italic;">into</span> the paper?!) also compress across the perpendicular north-south paralells.  Draw.  Draw what?  What else did anyone draw except two ways of a four-way intersection, empty, perfectly flat streets flowing between sharp-cornered buildings with more ambiguous windows.<br /><br />That's the reason.  Looking through that window, knowing the length of that normal to the surface which passes through me, knowing the angle between that normal and the path my eyes took to that strip of sand-brown-grey-white concrete, I knew <span style="font-style: italic;">exactly</span> where it was in relation to me, <span style="font-style: italic;">exactly</span> what it's dimensions were.  The moment of knowing is a moment of perceiving, and location is a function of perception.  Thus, Miami induces Art in me since, barely rising out of the smooth and level ocean on a low mound of warm-rinsed shit, exploding with the green and horrid things which feast upon it and each other, bearing Atlas-like the level cement lattice of geometrically expanding development, it is very, very, very <span style="font-weight: bold;">flat</span>.<br /><br />That constricted view from my constricted seat in our constricted flying machine, that useless appendix of a once-of-note access road, with voracious jungle shrubbery gnawing it into dust, with patient pools of chemically suspect water, is not Miami.  But nonetheless, when I saw it, I was suddenly standing upon it, and looking not back up at my projecting body on the plane like a long-distance doppelganger, but looking <span style="font-style: italic;">around</span>, and seeing nothing but Miami.  Short, sweaty, poor, arrogant, Miami.  My past, my secret self, my ami, Miami.<br /><br />Embarrassment ends when an explanation has been found, as with it is found an excuse, an opportunity to say "This is how it occurred, and since the cause does not lie with me, neither does responsibility.  I permitted nothing.  Rather, circumstances used me as a tool to effect events as they wished.  I absolve me."  According to this claim (and evidence supports it), with greater capacity for reason necessarily comes reduced capacity for shame and guilt.  I hope so.  I <span style="font-style: italic;">believe</span> it, which is to say, I require it of the universe.  This belief makes me eager, just now, to return to (hopefully reason-expanding) school, far from this place, as far as I can ever get while I remain compelled to remind people how little I like it.<br /><br />Dying is forgetting, they say, but I think killing is forgetting too.  Would I die, in that way, to kill Miami? <br /><br />No.  No, since that would be far too harsh a judgment on my parents, who I love, and on how they happened to raise me, which I am quite partial too.  Time will tell if Miami is indelible, but unlike some, I will not truly seek to destroy the source of my distaste.  I will be from where I am from.  I will hide nothing, and there will be nothing to hide.  Miami will disappear by a loss of contrast, not one of substance, which in any case, would be far more of a noticeable mark.<br /><br />It's hot and humid and flat here, and I'm enjoying it/myself.<br /><br />-Nick
