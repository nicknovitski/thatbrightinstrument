Jane McGonigal is about to <s>give a talk</s>&nbsp;have a conversation about her new book (<i>Reality is Broken</i>, available in fine bookstores everywhere, as well as my hot little hands).<br /><br />The CHM is ridiculous. &nbsp;Mountain View contains concentrations of wealth that I have not encountered anywhere in my life, and that includes, say, the Hearst Mansion, or the mansions of those latter-day Hearsts who populate Highway 1 between Cambria and Monterey. &nbsp;Imagine what sort of museum such people would make about the field that curls so closely about their hearts.<br /><br />I saw perhaps a quarter of it in two hours. &nbsp;Slide-rules, abaci, punch-cards, a bit of COLOSSUS. &nbsp;I will have to come back. &nbsp;Possibly I will have to become a member.
