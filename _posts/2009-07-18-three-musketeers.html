I recently finished reading <i>The Three Musketeers</i>.<br /><br />I admit to it not being very good.<br /><br />It's not so much "rousing" as "comedic." &nbsp;The protagonists never struck me as admirable, just funny. &nbsp;I was reminded of how I found Edmund Dantes of <i>The Count of Monte Cristo</i> to be shocking, and therefore entertaining, but hardly heroic. &nbsp;D'Artagnan and his friends are quite sure that they are special, blessed, impeccable. &nbsp;To their minds, their tastes and whims are the dictates not of fashion and foppery, but of the immortal laws of <i>aner</i>&nbsp;and <i>bonhomie</i>.<br /><br />I will further admit that I actually finished <i>Musketeers</i>&nbsp;a week or so ago, but my reaction to it made me decide to re-read <i>Le Club Dumas</i>.<br /><br /><iframe frameborder="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" scrolling="no" src="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=thatbriginst-20&amp;o=1&amp;p=8&amp;l=as1&amp;asins=B001TODOCM&amp;fc1=000000&amp;IS2=1&amp;lt1=_blank&amp;m=amazon&amp;lc1=0000FF&amp;bc1=000000&amp;bg1=FFFFFF&amp;f=ifr" style="height: 240px; width: 120px;"></iframe><br /><br />Arturo Perez-Reverte is both a genius and a Spaniard. &nbsp;Dumas might have been a genius, and certainly a Frenchman. &nbsp;They would be tied, but Reverte has the unbeatable advantage of being both a Romantic <i>and</i>&nbsp;a Modern...wait, I think this line of explanation will prove unhelpful. &nbsp;Let me try again.<br /><br /><i>Club Dumas</i> is about people who have intense relationships with books. &nbsp;The narrator is an expert on Romantic fiction, especially the great serials, the comic books of their times, the Dumas and the Rochambole and all the other mess. <br /><br />The hero is someone who knows a great deal about books in general, but more importantly, someone who is capable and commanding in their knowledge and self-control, whose manner harkens to a previous age of honor, despite professing no principles. &nbsp;"<i>In Corso's world, all the heroes were tired.</i>"<br /><br />The villain...the villains are two books, one of which is <i>The Three Musketeers</i>. Nearly every person encountered has their own reaction to that book, their own interpretation, favorite passage, character, turn of phrase. &nbsp;The impression given, then explicitly confirmed, is of a world within and beside our own, where everything is deliciously <i>literary</i>.<br /><br />Reading this book can't help but give you a fair understanding of Dumas and his work. &nbsp;It is the author's open love letter (or at least, a care-letter or concern-letter) to the heroic serials, just as <i>The Fencing Master</i> was his slightly more closed one.<br /><br /><iframe frameborder="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" scrolling="no" src="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=thatbriginst-20&amp;o=1&amp;p=8&amp;l=as1&amp;asins=0156029839&amp;fc1=000000&amp;IS2=1&amp;lt1=_blank&amp;m=amazon&amp;lc1=0000FF&amp;bc1=000000&amp;bg1=FFFFFF&amp;f=ifr" style="height: 240px; width: 120px;"></iframe><br /><br />Ahh, yes, <i>The Fencing Master</i>. &nbsp;That's the other one of Reverte's books I've read. &nbsp;It's set in Dumas' time, from which he wrote stories stretching back to an unreachable past when men were men, etc. &nbsp;And it stars, indeed, an old man who is a man, who has spent his life practicing the art of defending one's honor with a sword, and became a victim of his own success: he was good enough at it to live to see the day when even his simplest pupils realize that it's much less complicated to defend one's honor with guns. <br /><br />Unlike Quixote, his wits are not dry (nor are they particularly moist, if you follow), but his body's daily protests give him a constant reminder that his life is a fait accompli, that he has far less before him than behind...but, it would be unseemly for him to collapse into excessive melancholy, and insulting to regret his choices, the focus his life has taken. &nbsp;So he spends what spare time he can seeking knowledge of the perfect strike, against which it is impossible to defend (his&nbsp;temperament&nbsp;and philosophy demand that such a thing in fact exists, evidence to the contrary).<br /><br />He is so far the opposite of D'Artagnan that he comes back around the other side. &nbsp;Into his life, like D'Artagnan, a woman comes who does not perfectly fit into their shared society, who is beautiful, but unmarried, and who makes her own way in the world using her wits. &nbsp;And also like D'Artagnan, the story is essentially about their relationship, of which I may say nothing more, except that he is eventually forced to make a painful choice.<br /><br />So my capsule review is to read those books instead.<br /><br />-Nick
