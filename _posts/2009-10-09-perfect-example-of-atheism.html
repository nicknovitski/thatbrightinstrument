The most common definitions for atheism I hear is along the lines of "confidence in the non-existence of a creator deity."<br /><br />A more accurate simple definition would be "confidence in the lack of immediate, day-to-day significance of a creator deity." &nbsp;That is, if you believe that there is something mysterious and magical "out there," but that no one religion has a special line on it, or that or that it's not moved by prayers, then welcome to Atheismville, population y'all.<br /><br />Killing The Buddha is unsurprisingly full of examples, <a href="http://killingthebuddha.com/mag/confession/why-i-dont-pray/">one of which</a> was posted today, sparking my outburst.<br /><br />Dogs in the Vineyard players will know what I'm talking about, but it's not an uncommon meaning among the reformation and revival churches; they realized that most Catholics didn't really, you know <i>believe</i>&nbsp;believe in YHVH. &nbsp;They just believed in the Church (idolatry) or the power of Christ and the saints (also idolatry, though we free-thinking folks call it "polytheism" nowadays). &nbsp;This is how we talked at Sunday school and bible studies in my good old country home, Riviera Presbyterian.<br /><br />But beyond disputations between accepted, original, common and real original true definitions, there's a practical argument: it's just a very short step from thinking "people can be moral or immoral, and still follow the tenets of any or no religion" or "God is a diffuse inhuman omnipresence" to saying...<br /><br />Well, you either have made that step or you haven't. &nbsp;A speaker at St. Johns once compared process theology (that is, wrestling with the concept of God being both omnipotent and "good") to treading water in a pool: you can stop struggling any time you like by climbing up a number of ladders. &nbsp;Some people find the "well I guess the human definition of good is incorrect" ladder, and some reach the "this God idea isn't helping me any, is it" one. &nbsp;But both seem like cop-outs when you're in the pool. &nbsp;Sunk cost fallacy. &nbsp;"I've come this far," you shout. &nbsp;"Why stop now?"<br /><br />When you're in the pool, it seems to contain all struggle, all meaning and value. &nbsp;When you're out of it, it seems like a sideshow, a distraction from the rest of the world, an exercise that you might be glad to have done but you're probably glad to have done with. &nbsp;As for which is the correct perspective, the rationalist in me can only say:<br /><br /><blockquote><i>Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit. &nbsp;A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.&nbsp;Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.&nbsp;Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.</i></blockquote><div style="text-align: right;">KJV, Matthew 7:17-20</div>
