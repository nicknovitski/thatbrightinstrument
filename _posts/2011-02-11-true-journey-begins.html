Arrived in Memphis yesterday. &nbsp;Hope to reach Sallisaw, OK today. &nbsp;Then Amarillo tomorrow, and Albuquerque on Sunday. &nbsp;Fair progress after spending, what, two weeks in Virginia and three in Atlanta?<br /><br />Both were relaxing stays with friends. &nbsp;Too relaxing. &nbsp;I've gotten soft, become reliant on rolling out of bed and having real humans to talk to. &nbsp;Or at least dogs.<br /><br />Oh, right. &nbsp;In Atlanta, I stayed in a studio with a 7-month-old labrador puppy named Gracie. &nbsp;Things she destroyed of mine:<br /><br /><ol><li><i>Electric Dragon 80,000V</i>, a mildly rare artsy Japanese film. &nbsp;DVD, case, soundtrack CD: all shredded.</li><li><i>How To Cook Everything</i>, an awesome cookbook. &nbsp;Slipcase destroyed, index chewed.</li><li>40 Blinks Bucky Eyemask, devoured.</li><li>Vibram Fivefingers KSOs, munched.</li></ol><br />She was a good dog, though.<br /><br />Driving through Mississipi and Alabama in one day helped me realize how our current circumstances determine our Apocalypses. &nbsp;I kept seeing signs for the exits..."Food" it would say, with a perfectly blank hi-contrast expanse below. &nbsp;"Gas", and then "nothing besides remains / the lone and level roads stretch far away." &nbsp;Hence <i>The Road</i>, an exurban Apocalyps, where people become so distanced from each other and so cut off from resources, they have no way of productively dealing with one another. &nbsp;Compare with the rural Japanese Apocalypse of <i>Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou</i>, where life has just slowed down, with fewer kids in the village every year, and the beach slowly reclaiming the parking lots.<br /><br />So-called "Dystopias" are Apoclypses as well, of course. &nbsp;The world changes dramatically, the true nature of humanity (or of whatever you're afraid will constrain or warp it) reveals itself, is seen not through a glass darkly. &nbsp;I keep on thinking that they'll make a <i>Snow Crash</i>&nbsp;movie, that it's yet to be made irrelevant, that it can be condensed into a dayglo meditation on gated communities and franchise restaurants. &nbsp;And katanas, second life, wearable computing, and statutory rape, of course. <br /><br />McDonalds even have free wi-fi now, nearly as convenient and necessary as a bathroom. &nbsp;The future is like a low fire that a map of your life has been thrown onto: the edges burn first, but occasionally more mundane spots, closer to home, blacken and swell. <br /><br />O let me stand next to that fire!<br /><br />Yesterday, I stopped at a McDonalds to piss, and when I came out of the bathroom and headed to the door, someone on the staff sarcastically thanked me. &nbsp;A few seconds later, I reeled from social vertigo: I hadn't even thought them worth enough consideration to turn and fully face them before scoffing. &nbsp;I'm beginning to see why gypsies think it's okay to rob from non-gypsies. &nbsp;People tie themselves to one place, one job, one lover, expecting to be rewarded for...what? &nbsp;Self-doubt? &nbsp;Fear? &nbsp;Unquestioning service? &nbsp;They're like the blacksmith from the Borges story who wrapped his son in chains so that when he died from the weight, he could fly in heaven.<br /><br />Graduation, lay-offs, the death of a close family member...I'm overdue for throwing my life away on a crazy plan. &nbsp;Every day is a new opportunity to say "The Journey Begins Now." &nbsp;Initiation never ends.
