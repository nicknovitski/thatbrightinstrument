There are three game design ideas that have stuck with me long enough and provoked enough serious planning to be considered "projects."  One is code-named Leviathan.<br /><br />The setting hasn't changed much since I first conceived it.  A Space Station managed (not ruled, precisely) by an artificial intelligence committed to demonstrating the consistency and correctness of a certain social philosophy.  The end result being a cross between the urban underbelly chronicled in noir fiction and an enlightened technological utopia.  So to speak.<br /><br />The system has changed rapidly as I imagine different focuses for the game.<br /><br />Originally, I imagined it as for the computer, a cross between a Sim City and System Shock.  You would name a character, select from one of several backgrounds ("Betrayed and left for dead," "youngest son of da boss," etc.) which would effect your starting situation and abilities, then be let loose to do what you wanted.  The focus would be on the interplay between the different factions and forces in the setting with each other, especially as it is effected by the player.<br /><br />Then, I thought I might use the <a href="http://www.sorcerer-rpg.com/">Sorcerer</a> pen-and-paper roleplaying system.   Hard-bitten men and women left for dead, failed hustlers and movers, who Leviathan suffused with his own nanotechnology to create deniable assets to prosecute missions that defend the system against the excesses that it allows, so that no one figures out that the system is a failure.  The focus would be on the inhumanity demanded of citizens of the perfect urban society.  This is the phase where I came up with  a possible subtitle for the game that stuck with me: "Sci-fi Crime Fiction in the City of the Philosophers' Nightmares."  Not at all pretentious, of course.<br /><br />Most recently, I had a card-revelation.   Each player has a deck of variable size, with each card being a character (or property, or maybe some other things), consisting of one or two numbers, one or two abilities, and several links to other cards in your deck.  The focus would be on the interplay between factions I mentioned before, and their creation via their 'population.'  It occured to me that in this alien, yet all too familiar society, the term 'gang' might have lost its pejorative connotations, and become merely a term for associations of people working for a common goal in close fellowship; Basically the same things that are called 'Adventuring Parties' in Dungeons and Dragons, except in a modern urban setting, and born from the semi-shared motivations of its participants.<br /><br />So this is where I am now: looking for rules that govern different players creating and managing their gangs in conflict with one another, using cards.  For this to work at all, I needed an idea for the mechanic of gang organization.  So I did what anyone would (should) do: I searched for 'gang' on <a href="http://books.google.com/">google book search</a>, and found <a href="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0520074343&id=OkjBw39Q1kYC&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;pg=PP1&lpg=PP1&amp;ots=j6IH-g6D6u&dq=islands+in+the+street%5C&amp;sig=8l4jKXYxwzqAe4hk5sgK_LSfD9E">Islands in the Street: Gangs and Urban American Society</a>, by Martin Sanchez Jankowski.  Reading the preview that book search provides, how did I find the first chapter to open?<br /><br /><blockquote>To this war of everyman, against everyman, this is also consequent; that nothing can be unjust.  The notions of right and wrong, justice and injustice have there no place.  Where there is no common power, there is no law: where no law, no injustice.  force, and fraud, are in war the two cardinal virtues.<br /><br /></blockquote>With a quote from Thomas Hobbes' <span style="font-style: italic;">Leviathan</span>, of course!  So that was auspicious.  It looked like exactly what I was looking for.  After I clicked the 'find in libraries near me' button, and saw that a copy was at the Naval Academy library, it seemed to all be coming together.  Having had a friend check it out, I will now be engaging to read it, posting notes on the blog using the newly commissioned 'leviathan' tag.  The first post should come (relatively) soon, as I have pretty much finished the first chapter, and it will better explain just how suited the book seems to my task.  I don't expect to have anything ready to playtest at <a href="http://campnerdly.org">Camp Nerdly</a> or anything, but I hope to have some mechanics and cards to mess around with by the time school starts again.<br /><br />-Nick
