In which I list things that I would like to spend money on this weekend (and their venues), but then speak of them as if they were dead to me, in an effort to be fiscally responsible to my future selves.<br /><br /><b><i>They Live</i>, AFI Silver</b><br /><br />Since the invention of the fight sequence, there have been five that were known to be the most passionate, the most pure.  The central (though hardly pivotal or climactic) fight sequence in <i>They Live</i> does not leave them all behind, but it makes the list.<br /><br />This is hardly it's only accomplishment.  Almost anyone who has gone to a movie with me has heard me complain about over-exposition.  <i>They Live</i> is an ironic breath of fresh air, starring a homeless Roddy Piper (known as "the Rowdy) who has no friends (until he beats up Louis Gosset Jr, the aforesaid fight sequence the awesomeness of which you cannot understand from mere description); he has no one to talk to when he starts seeing things through an abandoned pair of shades that he doesn't want to believe might be real.  There's no voice over.  There's no text crawl.  You see what he does and you figure it out for yourself.  It's the model of what movies should be like nowadays: brave enough to admit they aren't so complicated that anyone with $10 in their pocket on Friday night will be able to understand what's happening just fine, even without any hand-holding.<br /><br />Since moving to Silver Spring, I swore that I would take advantage of the AFI Theatre's awesome selection and non-stop festivaling...some day.  But that that day is not this weekend.  Oh well!  Plenty of movies in the world, and I can't see them all!  Maybe I could finally polish off the last season of <i>Due South</i> instead!<br /><br /><b>Gnarls Barkley, 9:30 Club</b><br /><br />Man are they amazing.  Like, not just a little.  Cee-lo has a positively Orphic voice, and Danger Mouse aapparently fell through a portal from the cartoon universe of the Gorillaz as a child, and is trying to merge our plane with his homeland by making infectious tunes that are prayers in a language only he knows, and whose collective turning through our helplessly addicted minds will eventually build up enough power to subduct all or most of what we consider real beneath the mass of a world where "genre" is a word unknown to even the wise, and all movement is done to rythym and called music.<br /><br />The failure of my metaphor does nothing to decrease the potency of these people.  Folks talk about <i>Crazy</i> being their one wond'rous hit, but I have yet to hear the song of theirs that didn't leave me entirely hypnotized.<br /><br />Say, I already own one album of theirs!  I should just spin it up in my own pre-bought cd player!  With some carrots and apple juice, I'll have a concert of my own, from the comfort of home!<br /><br /><b>Brian Posehn, Arlington Cinema n' Drafthouse.</b><br /><br />To be sure, the name alone guarantees I must visit <a href="http://www.arlingtondrafthouse.com/">that establishment</a> eventually (or maybe wait until <a href="http://www.arlingtondrafthouse.com/montgomery.aspx">the one in my area</a> opens).  But when I do, it will be a shame that Mr. Posehn won't be there.  Stale off the successfully named "Comedians of Comedy" tour, with appearances as one of the nerdy but happily gay-married neighbors on the Sarah Silverman Program, and as that guy who dies right away in The Devil's Rejects, and a bunch of other stuff so you'd totally recognize him if you saw him, though my attempts to describe him as "Big, hairy, red, with glasses and a head like a boiled egg that came out wrong" will prove fruitless.  Will he play tracks from his metal band's only album, <a href="http://www.seeqpod.net/search/?plid=3c03d02c96">Nerd Rage</a>?  One can only hope and dream.<br /><br />Hey, maybe I can find some tracks of his online!  That'll be like going, but free from the slight yet pervasive fear I always have that live comedians will incorporate me into their performances to my discomfort and embarrasment!<br /><br /><b>Southern Culture on the Skids, 9:30 Club</b><br /><br />Funny story!<br /><br />So there I was, sometime in upper-middle school, reading this comic.  And by "read," I really mean "look at," because it was all in japanese and whatever.  And by "comic" I mean "sequential pornographic art."  Not being able to understand the dialogue, my understanding of the events was something like this:  There was this girl in a beret, moping around in an Anna Millers-type of restaurant.  That is, it's just like any other theme restaurant where the theme is "we demean the young women who need a job badly enough to work here by making them sell their fake interest and the nearness of their nubile flesh to the losers of the world," except when we objectify our ladies, it's usually with them wearing simple and nearly absent clothing.  But Anna Millers, they wear crypto-victorian maid and young-mistress-Alice outfits (also, they sell pancakes rather than hot wings, but who cares).  Tight, short-skirted, revealing in a way, but I never quite understood the allure.  It always reminds me of the Ferengi, the giant-eared money-grubbers from Deep Space Nine, who, it was said, invariably fantasized about wrapping the objects of their yellow-toothed, bulbous-forheaded affections in thick, opaque guaze.  To what end even the fevered imaginations of Star Trek Novel Fandom has been yet to guess, and if they do, I never want to hear about it.<br /><br />Anyway, this lady is moping in this restaurant, which I have to say outfits it's waitresses in a much racier way than the average Anna Millers-a-like.  Why there?  Because she too likes the girls in their pleated skirts and cheerily submissive dispositions.  She clearly longs after them, one in particular.  She wastes hours here, buying milkshake after milkshake, watching the waitresses flounce too and fro (especially fro), answering meekly whenever they ask her if there's anything else she'd like, then cursing her own shyness and unattainable passions in the staircase moments afterward.  So, it's a no-brainer: she's some loser guy who happened to be born a slim, attractive brunette.  After god knows how many months of this, the "Master" of the place sits down sits down in our heroine's booth.  The Master of an establishment is basically a bartender, except he can exist independantly of the bar, and both speaks and dresses in a way calculated to inject some Old World sophistication and foppery into the atmosphere.  As is usual in the fiction, this one is female.  Tall, with short blonde hair and an indolent smirk, she apparently sees right though to the lady-tagonist's perverted core, but rather than come out and say it, she drops a blush-inducing hint or three, then offers her a job at the place.<br /><br />A dream come true, and obviously one that leads to assorted health-code violating hijinks, but that's not what I'm talking about today.  The point is this:<br /><br />The lady goes home, bites the bullet, and starts to get ready for her on-the-job training.  And as we're treated to a relatively tasteful montage of her losing the baseball cap and sweatshirt, and getting dressed in her new demeaning/empowering Lewis Carrol-esque duds, and our (my) excitement is finally starting to build, or at least break ground, when all of a sudden, off to one side of the panel, context-free, english as life, it says: "Playlist: <a href="http://www.seeqpod.net/search/?plid=f62ca2173e">Southern Culture on the Skids - <i>Pass the Hatchet</i></a>."<br /><br />And you know what?  That comic was <i>right</i>.<br /><br />Anyway, their live shows are apparently really crazy, throwing buckets of KFC into the audience and what-have-you.  It'll be a shame to miss them.  Oh well!  It will probably be more fulfilling in the long run to spend that time reading the Qur'an!  Especially the parts about not abusing yourself.<br /><br /><b>Coldplay, Verizon Center</b><br /><br />I don't know why I feel the need to apologize for this one.  A terrible stigma hangs on those who like what other people like, I suppose, and yet the curse isn't powerful enough to keep me from plundering the tomb of these faux-akward londonites.<br /><br />I have this problem, perhaps from watching too many music videos, where songs give me over-specific visions of the stories that could be told to their tune.  Coldplay is strong in this particular force, so I make them a member of the Jedi Council of my heart, and enjoy every song like its a trailer for a movie I'd love to see if it was real.<br /><br />For example, though <a href="http://www.seeqpod.net/search/?plid=fef92bb330"><i>Clocks</i></a> is classic over-played hipster pop, it's the <i>Sail Away</i> to my Cartman: if I hear even one small part of it, I can't help but listen to the whole thing.  Why should I apologize for a graceful melodic race across the tops of the brightly lit red roofs, my heart racing while my mind stands still, leaping, crashing into the water, wishing it was you?<br /><br />Speaking of roofs, what's up with <a href="http://www.seeqpod.net/search/?plid=8f023e474d"><i>Cemetaries of London</i></a> talking about the "skies over london?"  We're what's up, that's what.  To the dead in their pine and marble, we walk in the sky, living in clouds of concrete and soot and the pain we inflict on eachother.  Uncare bears.  In any city of appreciable age the dead vastly outnumber the living, making their spaces the true spaces and ours the margins, much less in <i>Luandun</i>, "fortress of the moon," where Diana waxes and the ghosts gain substance and grime, until the most sensitive among us can feel diaphanous, fragile, wisps of wistful reels sung under a million breaths, barely heard among the teeming billions of dead. Where we are right now is heaven, and our sad, tired work, the work of angels.  Most who live don't know this truth, but you can hear it, if you carouse hard enough, in the pattern of pulses behind your eyes after you've been up and out long enough to become sober again in mystic proportion to the sun's rising, piecing yourself together in the gutter like Osiris and Isis, Enki and Inanna, John and Yoko, joined mystically in one, the <i>Chymical Hangover of Christian Rosenkreutz</i>, and you look at the sun and it hurts but you aren't quite yourself enough yet to know to look away and then you<br /><br />become<br /><br />*<br /><br />That's what I see/hear in it, anyway.<br /><br />But I bet the concert would have been loud full of annoying white people and I wouldn't have been able to make out the words.  I should play Guitar Hero instead!  It's mildly challenging demands on my motor control serve to enhance the pleasure of hearing music with a spice of illusory control!  Awesome!<br /><br />-Nick
