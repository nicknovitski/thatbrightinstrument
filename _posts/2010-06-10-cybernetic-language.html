<a href="http://www.examiner.com/x-16352-Japan-Headlines-Examiner~y2010m6d9-Kanji-for-common-use-count-increasing-to-meet-electronic-age">196 kanji are being added to the official list for common use (and five removed), due to a bunch of new objects being more common nowadays.</a><br /><br />Here's how Japanese writing works (skip to the section break if you know this): there are two syllabaries - Hiragana and Kana, which are mostly interchangeable, though one is more frequently used for loan words from other languages - and one ideograph set - the Kanji, Chinese characters. <br /><br />A syllabary is like an alphabet, except each mark corresponds to a syllable rather than a sound (or set of sounds, in English and similarly benighted tongues). &nbsp;So there are "letters" that mean "na" and "bo" and "o" and "gu" and so forth. &nbsp;There are a couple dozen, modified by diacritical marks and duplicated in the two systems. <br /><br />Ideographs are like hieroglyphics: symbols or images of varying levels of abstraction that have a specific meaning. &nbsp;Three birds might mean summer. &nbsp;A crocodile under water means danger. &nbsp;So there are "words" that mean "five" and "boy" and "motion as a wave" and so forth. &nbsp;Of course, these words are sometimes pronounced aloud, but unlike with alphabet or syllabary writing systems, their written form gives no clue as to how they're pronounced, and vice versa. &nbsp;Thus, there are many different spoken languages in China that use the character set that the Japanese call Kanji, and everyone pronounces them differently. &nbsp;In fact, most Kanji have at least two <i>completely</i> different ways of pronunciation just in Japanese! &nbsp;Imagine if the word for <a href="http://www.thejapaneseconnection.com/free-kanji-symbols/63_kanji_symbol_baseball.htm">baseball</a> could either be pronounced "baseball" or "coriander," and you're getting the idea.<br /><br />These systems are not entirely separate: they feed into one another. &nbsp;Every possible pronunciation of every Kanji can be spelled phonetically in Hiragana. &nbsp;And that's how Japanese word processors were made to work.<br /><br />So endeth that lesson. &nbsp;People skipping may resume reading here, please.<br /><br />No keyboard could contain all the Kanji. &nbsp;There are a few thousand on the "official list for common use" alone, and tens of thousands of more specialized ones for engineering and religious rituals and more besides. &nbsp;So instead, they have the Kana, which you use to type words phonetically. &nbsp;And then the computer will guess what Kanji you're trying to type (if any), and present it to you as an drop-down option. &nbsp;So you spell everything out, but the proper characters are inserted for you.<br /><br />So to make it clear: before the first working Japanese word processor could be made, they had to, repeat, <i>had to</i>&nbsp;write an autocomplete function, and every single one after that has included it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Without what we think of as the mixed luxury/drudge of as-you-type spell check, Kanji would be rapidly becoming a historical footnote, used only in newspapers no one reads and art that everyone patriotically appreciates but doesn't really understand.<br /><br />So now, everyone know how to read Kanji, but no one has to write them. &nbsp;Japanese folks are living in an age of <b>computer-mediated literacy</b>, way beyond our problems of no one knowing how to spell "independent" correctly without an animated paper clip telling them.
