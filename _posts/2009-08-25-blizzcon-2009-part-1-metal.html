<div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><i>[Edited to add pictures, and make my final point clearer. &nbsp;I accidentally published this a bit early...]</i><br /><br />Let's start at the end.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br />It's Saturday night. &nbsp;Casino-like, the permanent twilight of the cavernous (actually, caverns wished they had it this good) Anaheim convention center destroys all sense of time more precise than "I'm so tired, it should be night-time." &nbsp;And the impression is of a strangely decoration-free casino, with comfortable but subdued slot machines that use keyboards instead of levers, and food so over-priced you'll be forgiven for wondering whether something catastrophic has happened to the world since you walked in, whether outside this shaded oasis people are stabbing each other with sharpened spoons for the last can of baked beans.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br />Collect three and turn them for another day of subsistence.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_4s_kbVFrc84/SpR82azQk3I/AAAAAAAADLw/FLraCgCgGos/s1600-h/IMG_0175.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em;

margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">People filter in continuously. &nbsp;The hall has 12,000 seats, and it's standing room only over an hour before the show starts. &nbsp;After all, there all over 20,000 more people than that attending, though no doubt some have left early.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br />Losers.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br />Level 80 Elite Tauren Chieftain takes the stage and does their PG-13 set. &nbsp;Samwise, the singer, jokes that the band is in no danger of being paid for their music, gushes about the man he's opening for, and leads duelling group war-cries from people who self-identify as "Horde" or "Alliance."</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br />(I put the terms in quotes to hide the fact that I joined in. &nbsp;In my defense, if you're not familiar with the story of World of Warcraft, it's that the white people made friends with the "nice" other races, then prosecuted bigoted wars of extermination against the "bad" ones. &nbsp;So as I see it, you can be a racist, or you can prefer the Horde.)</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br />He jokes that they're tired of changing their level as Blizzard makes new expansions, so in protest, they're change it into a symbol. &nbsp;He then jokes about how many people in the audience are too young to get the joke.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br />It's fun. &nbsp;Cute. &nbsp;The lyrics scroll on the displays, so we can see how clever (ahem) they are.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br />They leave. &nbsp;Darkness reigns unchecked for a bit. &nbsp;People settle in, relax a bit. &nbsp;It's been a long day.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br />Then, Ozzy Ozbourne takes the stage. &nbsp;</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><b><br /></b></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><b><span style="font-size: x-large;">"</span></b><i><b><span style="font-size: x-large;">Are you ready to go fucking wild?!!</span></b></i><b><span style="font-size: x-large;">"</span></b></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px;

margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br />We did our best, we happy few 30 front rows, center aisle. &nbsp;We did our best to jump, scream, wave our arms. &nbsp;We did our best not to look behind us or to either side, to see people watching with a level of pleased interest and mild arousal usually reserved for tennis matches rather than&nbsp;<b>OZZY OSBOURNE IS RIGHT FUCKING THERE SINGING MR CROWLEY WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE</b></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br />On the monitors, he sometimes seemed stunned with disbelief. &nbsp;He knows, and we know now, that he can still rock. &nbsp;But even the true believers, we mesomorphic elite of the elite did our best to fill his vision, frequently fall short of the level of "fucking insanity" expected. &nbsp;He leads us in claps, hand waves, fist pumps, "Oi!"s. &nbsp;It's like the world's greatest Richard Simmons video, except it's half-way to the world's saddest rock concert.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_4s_kbVFrc84/SpR9b6LY4WI/AAAAAAAADMA/SFnNjYxeV_k/s1600-h/IMG_0217.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em;

margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br />(We're learning to make things that make better drugs than drugs do.)</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br />He's doing this as a favor. &nbsp;He doesn't phone it in. &nbsp;He's great. &nbsp;It's great. &nbsp;A perfect end to any day.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br />A telling end in this specific context, due to one particular part. &nbsp;But first, two other disparate points with, I'm convinced, a unifying theme.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br />In the center of the Blizzard campus, there is a "life-size" statue of an orc, riding a wolf, holding a pair of axes. Surrounding this statue is a wrought compass rosette. &nbsp;On the eight points are written the following:</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"></div><ul><li>Commit to Quality</li><li>Gameplay First</li><li>Every Voice Matters</li><li>Play Nice, Play Fair</li><li>Lead Responsibly</li><li>Learn &amp; Grow</li><li>Embrace Your Inner Geek</li><li>Think Globally</li></ul><div>Let me say again, at the center, the convergence of these values, lies frozen for eternity a roaring, hyper-muscled humanoid, wielding a war-axe in each hand, riding a freakishly large wolf-beast. &nbsp;At the heart of Blizzard is a core of Metal, literal and figurative.</div><br /><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">The statue is immobile, destined for future generations of archeologists to scoff at. &nbsp;It was decided, at an unknown time, that a portable, bronze version of the statue should be made, to be debuted at Blizzcon, and later taken to other places.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both;

margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">I was told that when it arrived, rather than the reported 600 pounds, the replica was found to weigh 1,600 pounds, and instantly shattered the base that had been prepared for it. &nbsp;The pieces were swept up, and the statue was left, perhaps as a warning to other furniture.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br />Quality is HEAVY. &nbsp;That means it takes work to make it and put it in the right place, but once it's there, it's easy to enjoy just by looking at it.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br />Bookending the convention, let's go back to the opening ceremonies, where the Monk was announced as another class for Diablo 3. &nbsp;Then they showed a picture, and I couldn't stop laughing for the entire trailer.<br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_4s_kbVFrc84/SpMEp9cmJWI/AAAAAAAADK4/HjJ1depUEec/s1600-h/ss90-hires.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em;

margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br />No, wait. &nbsp;Ignore the beard, <a href="http://www.blizzard.com/diablo3/media/movies/monk.xml">watch the trailer</a>.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br />Some people complain that the new Diablo is taking too many design hints from World of Warcraft, but the truth is, and the developers clearly know, that the game is at its best when, very unlike WoW, every step and click and death gives a delicious, bone-crunching feedback. &nbsp;It's like the first time you watched a good Dragon Ball Z fight, where people punch each other so hard that the shockwaves are visible <i>and therefore&nbsp;visceral</i>. &nbsp;Except you're a part of it, it's happening when you click!</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br />Back to the concert. &nbsp;So Ozzy says "<b><i>Good night, god bless</i><span style="font-weight: normal;">." &nbsp;And we're all like "Noooooo!" and then he's all "<i>Okay, gonna do some Crazy Train. &nbsp;But let me <unintelligible> genius kid. &nbsp;I found him in Japan, he's fucking <b>insane</b>.</unintelligible></i>"</span></b></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br />When Ozzy Osbourne says "kid," I picture someone my age.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br />A seven year old child carrying a flying V taller than he is walks out on stage.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_4s_kbVFrc84/SpR-GHGU5lI/AAAAAAAADMQ/4b8VcoJaCDw/s1600-h/IMG_0223.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em;

margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br />The kid is good. &nbsp;At several points, the lead guitarist stops playing and points at the kid with both hands while giving a "<i>Can you believe this shit?</i>" look to the camera. &nbsp;Ozzy lifts him up on one shoulder like he's Short Round at the end of <i>Temple of Doom</i>, when the villagers are all cheering and the elephant is happy and everything's right with the world.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br />The kid is very, very good. &nbsp;Does he know how good? &nbsp;All I know is that he's definitely happy to be there. &nbsp;The roar that met him when he came on stage caused him to start ever so slightly, but after that, the grin widened, and he was just having fun.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br />Playing guitars is just fun, for him, especially playing with Ozzy, who he knows is pretty good too, who wrote and sang songs that he's played and played, who's been practicing his craft and knows when he's in the mood / the feeling is right. &nbsp;And the people that Ozzy vouched for (even the drummer "Tommy...I don't know him") are pretty (VERY) good. &nbsp;And the lights and the sounds, and even the graphics on the screens, and all of us yelling our heads off and, at least, <i>imagining</i> smashing things and eating bats...What could be better?</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br />My point is: Ozzy &amp; Co. are Blizzard, and that kid was us. &nbsp;Blizzard is a band of experts and veterans who were all once fans of their medium, who still are. &nbsp;And the fans' engagement and excitement is infectious, would be infectious even if Blizzard didn't encourage us to <i>contribute</i>, to briefly stand on stage, to&nbsp;make art and jokes and stories and form a culture. &nbsp;It would be infectious even if they didn't actively recruit fans to join the band permanently, since they've got drive to "Commit to Quality" and to "Embrace Their Inner Geek."<br /><br />It would still be infectious without all that, because they are making it for us. &nbsp;It's not television, it's not fucking wood block prints, it's <i>games</i>, it's <i>metal</i>. &nbsp;They want to rock our socks off, and when we scream back that they are quite rocked, we are shaping them while being shaped, we are teaching and training them, perhaps directing them, and most importantly, we are contributing to the Thing, the Music, the Metal. &nbsp;We are up on stage and they are amazed at us. &nbsp;We're the kid, and they're Ozzy, or the band, that can cycle members, make new songs or new versions of old ones, that we can join some day, or at least enjoy for the rest of our lives, nursing a secretive smile that says "Maybe you wouldn't understand, but I'm part of that amazing thing."</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px;
