What's better than multiple train problems adding over an hour to your commute, causing you to miss both buses and walk through the summer heat along roads with only intermittent sidewalks?<br /><br />Yes, yes, &nbsp;many things, you're quite right. &nbsp;The correct answer in this case is: "Arriving to find that a water main break has shut down the building for the day, and finding a voice mail from over an hour before you left from your supervisor advising you of this."<br /><br />Well, I have internet access, and it's a beautiful day.<br /><br />-Nick
