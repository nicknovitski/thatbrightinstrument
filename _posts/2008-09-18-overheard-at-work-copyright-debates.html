Less overheard than over-read in the notes on a given ticket. &nbsp;The exchange went something like this:<br /><blockquote>Customer: Hey, thanks for those business cards files you made for us. &nbsp;They're great. &nbsp;But we'd like to be able to edit them. &nbsp;Right now they're PDFs, so there's apparently no way to change them? &nbsp;Anyway, make them something else that we can edit however we want.</blockquote><blockquote>Us: Yeah, you can't edit PDFs unless you buy the right software from Adobe. &nbsp;So you can do that, or, if it's something small you want changed, you can tell us, and we'll bill the work at our usual rate. Incidentally, we gave you pdfs because you originally just asked for something to print directly with a minimum amount of fuss.</blockquote><blockquote>Customer: WTF? &nbsp;We paid you for business cards, and you gave us business cards. &nbsp;We own them now. &nbsp;Why should we have to pay money to change something that we own? &nbsp;Is this...is this a scam? &nbsp;I mean, you must be joking. There's no way this is for real.<br /></blockquote><br />Yeah, proprietary file formats are a bitch, aren't they? &nbsp;Especially when they become industry standards, like several of Adobe's properties have. &nbsp;"Oh, you thought that you had the right to do whatever you want with something you bought? &nbsp;Ahaha! &nbsp;It is to laugh!" <br /><br />Daniel has remarked in the past that he'll care about the cause of open formats when someone gives him a compelling reason to care. &nbsp;Which is strange: he cares about lots of other things that have yet to affect him directly. &nbsp;This one seems like a no-brainer to me.<br /><br />-Nick
