This past week I finished two books and began a third.<br /><br /><i><b>The Fencing Master</b></i><br /><br />It may be that Arturo Perez-Reverte cannot fail to entertain me. So far, I only have two data points on which to base that prediction - this delicately yet fiercely arranged period/suspense/mystery story, and <i>The Club Dumas</i> - but they have enough in common (to my pleasure) that I feel I have basis for hope.&nbsp; Both feature a protagonist defined by being capable in some ways and incapable in others.&nbsp; These latter, more constraining ways showcase that fear (universal?&nbsp; just me?) that the die is cast now and forever, that there will never be, for us, anything more than what there is right now, and the dingiest fading echo of arbitrary used-to-bes.&nbsp; The protagonists faces this horror, shaking, and then does what holds to his ethics anyway.&nbsp; This makes him awesome, even though there is no one around to see it, besides us, the reader.<br /><br />Klingon's say that the stars see what we do, and remember.&nbsp; That certainly ranks among the best fantasies: "What I have done is known, and I am understood."&nbsp; There's certainly nothing (feasible) that I want more fiercely.&nbsp; But the heroes of these books prosecute their moralities (both of which are mistaken by those around them as a kind of affected lack-of-morality) even in the face of ignominy, and annihilation.&nbsp; When I admire this, am I taking into account that I am acting as a star to them, as their judge on the Last Day?&nbsp; God, Augustine and others have pointed out, perceives our lives not unlike the way we perceive a book, with each page existing equally, not distinguished by the properties "now," "past" or "to come," with the whole course of a life seen entirely, all connections made, a book that is also a diamond that is also a thought.&nbsp; So that's us, when we read.<br /><br />So anyway, there's no telling how much the other books will follow this pattern, but it's a good sign.&nbsp; Just like, anyone who enjoys Umberto Eco's first book will find it very hard to hate any of them.&nbsp; But then, maybe that's just because he started writing late in life?&nbsp; He was fixed in his ways?&nbsp; Leaving a testament rather than exploring new modes of being?&nbsp; <i>The Mysterious Flame</i> certainly reads like an epitaph...<br /><br />I think that, besides his beautiful and moving books that have changed my life, the other reason Umberto Eco is precious to me is that he didn't start writing award-winning world-famous fiction until his advanced years.&nbsp; I like to think that sometime in the course of my life, a pill will be invented that will grant me the focus that I've never been able to marshal effectively, and I'll be able to write everything that I have ever thought which I still think is worth disseminating.<br /><br />Anyway, more Perez-Reverte is to be put into my schedule.<br /><br /><i><b>Anna Karenina</b></i><br /><br />My faculty advisor for my senior essay on <i>War &amp; Peace</i> asked me to read this and tell him what I thought.<br /><br />Actually, he wanted to know whether I thought it or <i>War &amp; Peace</i> was "better."&nbsp; Apparently, this is what literary folk talk about.&nbsp; I would respond by saying that they're different things.&nbsp; <i>War &amp; Peace</i> didn't seem as much like a novel: it was more "about" broader subjects - our place in the universe, the way we grow and develop, war, peace, etc - than "about" individual people.&nbsp; The principle characters in <i>Karenina</i> seem distinct, not standing in for archetypes (as much).&nbsp; Here are these people.&nbsp; Here are the things they do.&nbsp; Here is a section of their mere lives.&nbsp; Of course, both works are nearly unequalled in the degree to which they convincingly portray those lives.&nbsp; Your annoyances (and don't worry, you will have them, you 21st-century free-thinker, you) will be directed at the characters, as if they were real people, rather than at the book or author, for being obtuse or parochial.<br /><br />Though I am annoyed at him dropping the ball on universality.&nbsp; "Wait a minute, isn't my moral-philosophical revelation accessible to all people, even if they were ignorant of my religion?...ahh, who knows.&nbsp; Moving on!"<br /><br />I think it's at least as difficult to understand biologically different folks than it is to understand culturally different folks.&nbsp; The sensitivity and deftness Tolstoi exhibits when portraying women (which he was also not one of) didn't go so far as "the Turk?"&nbsp; Or really, that such a clear and beautiful mind would have not have questioned whether the trappings of his church was the <i>source</i> of his morality, or just happened to <i>sit well </i>with his morality?&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyway, it's beautiful, and sobering.&nbsp; A morality play, though it convinced me less about the dangers of (spoilers!) adultery, and more about the dangers of taking yourself too seriously and of psychically tearing yourself apart.<br /><br /><b><i>Al Qur'an</i></b> <br /><br />It's beautiful, and more engaging on average than the Torah or Bible so far, and full of amusing quotes I think I'm going to try to collect.&nbsp; Plus, I revel in the thought of shocking people who notice what I'm reading.&nbsp; But of course, no one's actually said anything, except the one person who asked if I finished <i>Anna Karenina</i>.<br /><br />-Nick
