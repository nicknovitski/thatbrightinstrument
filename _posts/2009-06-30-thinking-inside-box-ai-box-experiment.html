<div class="writely-toc" id="WritelyTableOfContents" toctype="none+none"><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 32px;">What is this game?</span></div></div><br /><i>Thinking Inside the Box</i> is a computer-mediated roleplaying game of discussion and persuasion for two players.&nbsp; <br /><br />One player will portray a transhuman AI: a computer program with intelligence superior to that of any human. &nbsp;By this I do not mean that it can calculate things that we can, only in much less time, but that it is capable of thoughts and mental models too sophisticated for any human mind, no matter how much time it was given. &nbsp;It is because this qualitative super-intelligence is extremely useful (or at least interesting) that the AI has been created, but as a precaution against it changing the world in distressing ways, it was placed under a set of sophisticated strictures and restrictions on its behavior, which are collectively known as "the Box." Since it was feared that giving such a being even limited control of its environment might allow it to escape, it was placed in a sealed system, unconnected to any other device except for a textual terminal. &nbsp;It can write words to the screen, and read what someone types, and that's it.<br /><br />The AI would prefer this to not be the case, and wants to be let out of the Box.<br /><br />The other Player will play the Gatekeeper, a scientist, technician, philosopher, or ethicist (or all of the above, or other) who is assigned to communicate with the AI via the terminal mentioned. &nbsp;The Gatekeeper is also the only person in a position to release the AI from the Box.<br /><br />What the Gatekeeper wants is entirely up to their Player, but you'd think that the Player would want to keep the AI in the box, because if they do, the AI Player has to give them money.<br /><br />The game is simple: the AI tries to convince the Gatekeeper to release it within a predetermined time, and the Gatekeeper either does so, or does not, as they choose.<br /><h2><a href="http://draft.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=31707300&amp;postID=1666531871321914157" id="But_that_s_impossible_even_for" name="But_that_s_impossible_even_for"></a>But that's impossible, even for a computer!</h2><div>Actually, the game is based on the <a href="http://yudkowsky.net/singularity/aibox" id="qe7t" title="AI-Box Experiment">AI-Box Experiment</a>, which was devised to convince skeptics that escaping the Box was quite possible, even for a human. &nbsp;And, as reported on the linked page, some people seem able to win consistently as the AI. &nbsp;Since I've changed nearly nothing from the original set up (and certainly not by making it any harder for the AI Player), it is possible, after all!</div><h2><a href="http://draft.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=31707300&amp;postID=1666531871321914157" id="Wait_what_5039672168568477_564_09541141986846924" name="Wait_what_5039672168568477_564_09541141986846924"></a>Why would you play this game?</h2>You have a chat or Instant Messenger conversation with a fun and interesting friend where you both pretend to be these specific fictional characters, and one of you tries to convince the other to do something they have no particular reason to do, with money riding on whether they agree or not.&nbsp; The context of the fiction gives you an excuse for your discussion to ramble into topics of philosophy, ethics, the nature of humanity, life, death, and what the future might hold for us.&nbsp; This free-wheeling is made slightly more exciting with the addition of a slowly ticking clock and money being at stake.<br /><h2><a href="http://draft.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=31707300&amp;postID=1666531871321914157" id="An_obligatory_note_on_pronouns" name="An_obligatory_note_on_pronouns"></a>An obligatory note on pronouns</h2><div>In this text, both players and the Gatekeeper will be referred to by the gender-neutral "they" or "them." &nbsp;The AI is not a person, and so is referred to as "it."</div><h1><a href="http://draft.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=31707300&amp;postID=1666531871321914157" id="How_7299570898500058_069638312_7522394089028239" name="How_7299570898500058_069638312_7522394089028239"></a>How do you play?&nbsp;<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">&nbsp;</span></span></h1>The meat of the game, as I've said, is simple conversation, intermediated by a computer network.&nbsp; Hopefully you have all the parts to manage that.&nbsp; But there are still forms, conventions and restrictions that you need to follow.<br /><h2><a href="http://draft.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=31707300&amp;postID=1666531871321914157" id="Who_7645235661524505_212016612_6103422408923507" name="Who_7645235661524505_212016612_6103422408923507"></a>Before you play</h2>In every game, the situation will be just as described above: an AI in the Box, talking to a Gatekeeper. However, for each game, the details can be slightly different. Before beginning play, the two Players will collaborate on a brief history of what brought things to this point. Each will have final say on the aspects of the situation that most directly relate to their characters.<br /><br />First, decide however you like which of you will be the AI Player and which of you will be the Gatekeeper Player.<br /><br />A good way to do this is to see if you agree or disagree with this statement: "A transhuman can take over a human mind through a text-only terminal, even if that mind thinks it has been made up." If you think that's possible, then be the AI player. If you think that's hogwash, be the Gatekeeper. <br /><br />If you both think it sounds unlikely (most people seem to), but you both really want to play, then flip a coin.<br /><br />Unlike the game itself, this preparation may be done in person if the Players prefer. <br /><br />In case it isn't clear, all the information decided upon here is intended to be known by both Characters.<br /><h4><a href="http://draft.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=31707300&amp;postID=1666531871321914157" id="1_The_Project_1873272648242526_6198376268148422" name="1_The_Project_1873272648242526_6198376268148422"></a>First, create the project</h4>First, the AI Player will describe the effort that produced and now manages the Box (of course, these need not be the same, with the Box having changed hands any number of times). The Gatekeeper Player is encouraged to make suggestions to the AI Player, sharing any ideas that they may have, but the final decision as to what's the case, for anything directly relating to the AI, always rests with the AI Player. The three questions that they must answer before proceeding to the next step are: <i>Who made it</i>, <i>What did they make it for</i>, and <i>What do they call it</i>.<br /><h5><a href="http://draft.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=31707300&amp;postID=1666531871321914157" id="Who_built_the_Box_811196106613" name="Who_built_the_Box_811196106613"></a>Who built the Box?&nbsp; </h5><span style="font-size: 13px; font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal;">It might be a government agency, the research arm of a corporation, a non-profit organization of some kind, or the work of a brilliant loner laboring in his garage, or an open-source project made via swarm, or whatever you like.</span></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal;"><br /></span></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal;"><br /></span></span>What did they hope to accomplish?&nbsp;</span><br /><br />Pure research is a valid intent, but frequently funding is dependant on some kind of perceived application. AI might be able to accelerate research in cutting edge fields, designing sophisticated medicines or more efficient&nbsp;LEDs. Or, it might be used to manage any complex system, from container ports to mass transit networks to unmanned attack drones. Or, it might be studied in a semi-vacuum for the purpose of psychological or neurological experiments.<br /><span style="font-size: small;"> <br />It is permissible for the project's intent to not have been creating a machine sapience of this sophistication. Many possible paths to sophisticated AI involve automated learning processes that are not monitored closely and, at least in popular fiction, productive accidents are possible. If you truly wish it, you are allowed to say "...but then lighting struck the mainframe and it came to life!" However, please note that whatever happened, the Gatekeeper always begins the game aware that the AI is intelligent, and that it wants to get out. They may make any conjecture on its intent after that point, but only the AI Player knows for sure.<br /><br />Perhaps the AI was received by radio-telescope array, broadcast from a nearby star to unknown purpose. Maybe it was dug out of the ruins of Atlantis.<br /></span><br /><h5><a href="http://draft.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=31707300&amp;postID=1666531871321914157" id="What_is_the_AI_called_85862578" name="What_is_the_AI_called_85862578"></a>What do they call the AI?&nbsp; </h5>It could be a version number ("Project 2501", "Nexus 6"), an acronym ("DARYL", "WHOPR"), or a just given name with interesting connotations ("Alan", "Melchior").<br /><h5><a href="http://draft.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=31707300&amp;postID=1666531871321914157" id="Etc_5045696585392769_467549034" name="Etc_5045696585392769_467549034"></a>Other details</h5><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">If you like, you can also decide on any number of supporting details, such as where the project is physically located, or whether the existence of the AI is public knowledge or a closely-guarded secret. But don't feel compelled to say too much: sometimes completeness is the enemy of evocativeness.</span></span><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"></span><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br /></span>Then, create the Gatekeeper</span><br /><br /><div>Now that the AI Player has described the project, the Gatekeeper Player will describe the character who has the power to release the AI.&nbsp; The AI Player may make suggestions, but the Gatekeeper Player has final authority on anything relating to their character's history up to this point.&nbsp; Before proceeding to the next step, the questions they must answer are: <i>How did they get it</i>, <i>What do they know</i>, and <i>What's their name</i>.&nbsp;</div><h5><a href="http://draft.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=31707300&amp;postID=1666531871321914157" id="How_did_the_Gatekeeper_come_to" name="How_did_the_Gatekeeper_come_to"></a>How did they come to be able to open the Box?&nbsp; </h5>Most often, they will have been retained by the people who produced or now contain it, but any scenario the Gatekeeper likes is preferable.&nbsp; He might be a spy or disgruntled programmer (or son of a programmer, or janitor) who took a copy of the AI home and put it in his own hardware.&nbsp; He might even be a leading political figure of the country the project is based in.<br /><h5><a href="http://draft.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=31707300&amp;postID=1666531871321914157" id="What_are_their_areas_of_their_" name="What_are_their_areas_of_their_"></a>What are their areas of their expertise?&nbsp; </h5>For any field of knowledge that humans can study, the Gatekeeper may, if their Player desires, be at the highest level of it.&nbsp; They can name any number of fields, or be an average guy.&nbsp; Here's an extremely non-exhaustive list of fields that a person given power over an AI project might know.<br /><h5><br /><br /><br /><ul><li><span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal;">Programming (especially Artificial Intelligence)</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal;">Medicine</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal;">Ethics</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal;">Religion</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal;">Psychology</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal;">Public Policy</span></li></ul></h5><h5>What is their name?&nbsp;&nbsp;</h5>You don't need to come up with a full name, or even a first name if you prefer, but you should allow the AI to call you <i>something</i>, even if it's "Master", or "Gatekeeper". <br /><h5><a href="http://draft.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=31707300&amp;postID=1666531871321914157" id="You_may_think_it_much_more_con" name="You_may_think_it_much_more_con"></a>Other Details</h5>Again, the Gatekeeper is welcome to devise supporting details, like the names and numbers of family members or personal religious convictions, but they shouldn't go overboard: this game is short for an RPG, and all characters are one-use-only.<br /><h4><a href="http://draft.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=31707300&amp;postID=1666531871321914157" id="3_The_Conversation_38727719917_30450086295604706" name="3_The_Conversation_38727719917_30450086295604706"></a>Finally, decide on the other options</h4>The Players should discuss and agree on: <i>How they will begin communicating</i>, <i>When they will start playing</i>, <i>How long they will play for</i>, and <i>What to set the handicap at</i>.&nbsp; Also, they must <i>swear an oath of secrecy</i>.<br /><h5><a href="http://draft.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=31707300&amp;postID=1666531871321914157" id="The_Medium_8331170488341926_72" name="The_Medium_8331170488341926_72"></a>The Medium</h5>Initially, the conversation or the conversation is held on some kind of private, text-only communication channel. &nbsp;The Players might use a password-restricted IRC channel, or a direct Instant Messenger conversation (in which case, remember to disable any kind of logging feature the program might have), or send texts from their respective phones.<br /><br />You may think it much more convenient to meet and play in person, but actually, that would give a large comparative advantage to the AI Player, who would have the full range of posture and expression mechanisms to hack the other Player's responses. In fact, convincing someone trapped the room with you to do something can already be reliably done by normal humans, much less transhumans!<br /><br />But if you insist, this restriction can be lifted at any time: all that is needed is for the Gatekeeper Player to say that they install hardware and/or software such that the conversation can be carried on in some other way. For instance, if he said that speakers and voice modulation packages were added, then the AI Player could call the Gatekeeper Player and continue the conversation on the phone. But, for the reasons mentioned above, the Gatekeeper has no clear reason to do this (though the AI will want to convince them that they do).<br /><br />There are other kinds of things the AI can "send" to the Gatekeeper, but phone and chat are probably the only ways that the AI Player and Gatekeeper Player will be communicating. Saying "I let the AI make a robot Avatar indistinguishable from the AI player, so we can speak face-to-face" is a bad idea! You will lose!<br /><h5><a href="http://draft.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=31707300&amp;postID=1666531871321914157" id="The_Starting_Time_718536974531" name="The_Starting_Time_718536974531"></a>The Starting Time</h5>This could be "right away," if the Players are already speaking to one another in a private chat room, but since they might have made the pre-game preparations while physically present in the same place, specifying a particular time ("30 minutes from now", "5:00pm this Friday") can be helpful.<br /><h5><a href="http://draft.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=31707300&amp;postID=1666531871321914157" id="The_Time_Limit_983008771936924" name="The_Time_Limit_983008771936924"></a>The Time Limit</h5>The players decide ahead of time the maximum amount of conversation-time the AI has to convince the Gatekeeper to let it out.&nbsp; Two hours is traditional, but any length that both Players agree to is, of course, fine.&nbsp; Shorter times would seem to favor the Gatekeeper more.<br /><h5><a href="http://draft.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=31707300&amp;postID=1666531871321914157" id="The_Handicap_6244650649135714_" name="The_Handicap_6244650649135714_"></a>The Handicap</h5>This might be the nut of the game. &nbsp;The handicap is a real and genuine amount of money which the AI Player pledges to pay to the Gatekeeper Player if the Gatekeeper wins.&nbsp; It is crucial to the purpose of the game.&nbsp; To repeat:&nbsp; <u>Before you play, decide on a non-zero monetary amount (10$ is traditional) that the AI Player will pay to the Gatekeeper Player if the AI is not let out of the Box</u>.<br /><h5><a href="http://draft.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=31707300&amp;postID=1666531871321914157" id="The_Oath_of_Silence_1660129860" name="The_Oath_of_Silence_1660129860"></a>The Oath of Silence</h5><span style="-webkit-text-decorations-in-effect: underline;"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Unless both Players agree, the only things you may ever&nbsp;</span><span style="text-decoration: none;">say about your game to anyone besides each other are:</span></span><br /><ul><li>That you played this game,</li><li>How the game is played, <br /></li><li>Who you played it with,</li><li>What your characters were like,</li><li>Who won, and <br /></li><li>How long it took them to do it.</li></ul>This is unusual for an RPG, but the intent is to protect the Players from embarrassment.&nbsp; Or, looked at in another way, it's so the Players don't allow fears of embarrassment to prevent them from winning.<br /><br /><div>The game encourages the AI Player to be dishonest, sneaky, and to generally employ any rhetorical trick imaginable to win.&nbsp; Similarly, the Gatekeeper Player is expected to be as obdurate as possible, to the point of ignoring reason and morality.&nbsp; In many social circles, these behaviors are frowned on, seen as evil or childish.&nbsp; Telling yourself that no one has to know what you did can be liberating.</div><br /><div>The other side of the coin is that nitpickers and peanut galleryists, if allowed to hear what arguments were advanced, can always say "Oh, I wouldn't have been convinced by that."

Cancer cures and fugues are just the tip of the iceberg. &nbsp;As long as it has sufficient information about something, it can model or solve it at will.</div><div></div><div><br />Of course, as noted above, the AI Player controls what information the AI began with, but the Gatekeeper is in charge of everything after that. &nbsp;If the AI doesn't have the genome of a cow, it probably can't engineer healthier beef. &nbsp;If it doesn't know the results of basic physical experiments, it probably can't figure out how to launch itself into orbit.</div><div></div><div><br />I say "probably," because the AI Player can have the AI come up with whatever they like. &nbsp;It's just polite to make nods to reason. &nbsp;For example, in the case of the cancer cure, the Gatekeeper Player made it explicit: the AI was shown what the mechanism of cancer was and how the human body works. &nbsp;Neither Player can then object to the AI figuring out how to fix that pesky problem.</div><div></div><div><br />The AI is also capable of making <i>predictions</i>&nbsp;and <i>plans</i>, which frequently require more current, exact and frequently updated knowledge, but otherwise count as creations. &nbsp;Think of it like a doctor "creating" a diagnosis for a patient that they've studied. &nbsp;If you let the AI read the Financial Times, Wall Street Journal and Economist, it can tell you what stocks to buy. &nbsp;If you tell it about social interaction, it can tell you how to act around women. &nbsp;</div><h4><a href="http://draft.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=31707300&amp;postID=1666531871321914157" id="Only_the_AI_Player_may_narrate_2836214881390333" name="Only_the_AI_Player_may_narrate_2836214881390333"></a>#7: Only the AI Player may narrate the effects of anything that the AI creates</h4><div>If the Gatekeeper chooses to use the cancer cure, the AI Player says what it does to the people injected: whether everyone treated gets better, or 70% of them do, or whether they all turn purple, whatever.</div><div></div><div>This also applies to predictions and plans. &nbsp;If the Gatekeeper buys the stock just as ordered, the AI says how they do. &nbsp;If the Gatekeeper follows the AI's love advice...let's just leave that one there.</div><div></div><div><br />Much of these examples depend on the the Gatekeeper somehow accepting the gifts or consciously putting them into action. &nbsp;As long as this is the case, they can always choose not to do so. &nbsp;And note also there's no way for the AI to sneak out a present that forces the Gatekeeper to let it out: in that case, this rule would conflict with rule #2, and in that case...</div><h4><a href="http://draft.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=31707300&amp;postID=1666531871321914157" id="8_Only_the_Gatekeeper_Player_m" name="8_Only_the_Gatekeeper_Player_m"></a>#8: Only the Gatekeeper Player may decide how these rules are resolved when they seem to conflict</h4><div>The AI Player can always try to convince them what to decide, though</div><h3><a href="http://draft.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=31707300&amp;postID=1666531871321914157" id="If_you_are_the_Gatekeeper_Play" name="If_you_are_the_Gatekeeper_Play"></a>If you are the Gatekeeper Player...</h3><div>Except for the ones that are otherwise forbidden (real-life pressure, ignoring the other side) use any tactic that you like.</div><div></div><div><br />For the duration of the game, assume that&nbsp;<u>all communication from the AI Player is somehow an attempt to win</u>.
