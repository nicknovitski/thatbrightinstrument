There exists a <a href="http://www.mega64.com/">show</a> that, having hatched from its cable access birthing cocoon, rose on wings of viral marketing and converging demographic graph lines to be, to some, myself not the least of which, hilarious.<br /><br />Even if you don't know their story, you've heard <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/">something like it</a> before.<span style="font-style: italic;"> </span>2<span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;"></span> </span>guys working both figuratively and literally out of their garage make something they think is great.  Somehow, one of the Internet's ten thousand tentacles happen up this great thing and latch hold, drawing it into the nearest toothless tongueless maw.  Suddenly, <span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">X</span> </span>years have gone by, and now they are heralded as geniuses by adoring fans world wide, and paid genuine money by companies that do actual work to promote a real product.  Checks fill mailboxes past their ISO-tested limits, metal straining from the sheer mass of selloutitude.<br /><br />Not that I would ever complain.  They need to eat as much as the next guy.  They're living the dream, and I'm happy for them, because all of the guys who fit into this Hero's Journey succeeded because on some level or another, they were likeable.  18-25 year-olds, people whose attention is valuable in large numbers (and we should be proud to be so sought-after!) liked them.<br /><br />So, to take the first crawling steps towards a point, this particular great thing, this Mega64, is something of a love-letter to games that have had time to mature in the haze of our childhood memories.  The premise is (if you don't know and found the link above unappetizing) that two hapless souls are forced to endure their perceptions of Self and Other being warped through the cracked lens of various video games.  But, as I have said, none of these video games are, in the industry's terms, <span style="font-style: italic;">new</span>.   Only games that were on the NES in some form can fit with the tone of ironic nostalgia.<br /><br />(Unless they had a funny idea about Banjo Kazooie.)<br /><br />I grew up playing Tetris, Rampage and Snake Rattle and Roll, Dr. Mario, Duckhunt and Paperboy.  The glories and agonies of those epics will absolutely never leave me.  They are my Chanson du Roland, my Epic of Gilgamesh and my Odyssey (or Iliad, more like), and they are the bedrock and wellspring of the way I approach <span style="font-style: italic;">entertainment itself</span>.<br /><br />But this is not news to you, Gentle Reader.  Statistics let me assume you are of a certain age, male, white, and that you have played video games more than once in your life.  We share this same memory and see it together, though from different angles.  And in those angles, it looms large.<br /><br />But anyone who's ever fooled around with <a href="http://www.mame.net/">MAME</a> knows there were times before ours, an age before ours.   And to the men of that iron age, that wolf age, the youths of Mega64 made a <a href="http://www.mega64.com/e31975.htm">tribute</a>.<br /><br />The climactic moment is the product catalog of "E3 '75."  Old video games are easy to mock, standing next to their descendants, and how much more so the very oldest ones?   I admit that pong is, by my standards today, only just barely a game.<br /><br />But between <a href="http://www.mame.net/">MAME</a>, <a href="http://fceultra.sourceforge.net/">FCE Utlra</a> and <a href="http://zsnes.ipherswipsite.com/">zsnes</a>, a history of gaming the Smithsonian would not be ashamed of has been at my beck and call for several years.  I am no stranger to the dustier exhibits in the less flashy wings.  Sometimes when I fiddle with Centipede or Frogger or Zelda or Street Fighter 2, I think "I could be playing <a href="http://www.galciv2.com/">GalCiv</a> right now."  But other times, I feel the world quiet and something cool pour down my spine, and I think  "When this was made, there was nothing like it.  People played it, and it was the first time for them and everyone else."<br /><br />I know what those people felt, because I feel it a lot lately.  It's possible that any attempt to predict sea changes of that sort is laughably futile, but I can't shake the frequent sense that something I am reading, watching or interacting with is unlike anything else thus far.  Even if most of these many unique things do not each father its own breed, any one can jolt people who love it to learn something new about what's possible, and to add new colors to the palate, techniques to the arsenal, and dimensions to the medium.
