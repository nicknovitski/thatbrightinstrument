<div>Google Calendar does good work, so I was briefly excited by <a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/OfficialGmailBlog/~3/BniM0B3-vPI/new-in-calendar-sports-schedules-and.html">the announcement that they'll make it easy for you to track world-wide sports schedules.</a></div><br /><div>But woe!  You can <i>only</i> subscribe to a given team's schedule! That's great for people who strongly identify with a certain team, but what if I just want the full NFL or Serie A schedule on my calendar?  Well, I have to subscribe to each team's feed, which means that my list of calendars gets cluttered and every event shows up twice (once for each of the teams playing). <br /><br />I think this is a pretty gross oversight, though I'm inclined to be forgiving, partly because it's some poor intern's pet project, and partly because it's easily fixed: just add an "All Events" entry at the lowest folder level.</div><div></div><div>In the meantime, you can always set up emailed reminders for every Oregon Ducks game, and even if it's not being shown in your area (likely), the event will automatically be updated with the score in real time.<br /><br />(I was going to insert a joke here about the Southeastern Conference suing Google over that feature, but the merest touch of research told me that little storm-in-a-teapot actually boiled over with a&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.al.com/solomon/2009/08/sec_to_fans_tweeting_now_allow.html">sudden outbreak of common sense</a>. Well played, SEC.)</div><br />-Nick
