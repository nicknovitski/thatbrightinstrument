Steak for dinner and for breakfast tomorrow. &nbsp;Low carb lets you lose weight without counting calories, because the calories you eat are so damn filling. &nbsp;I see that there's a microwave in the hotel room, and immediately think I could make bacon if I had a plate and some paper towels (and some bacon). &nbsp;Meals on the road tend to be raw. &nbsp;Hotels don't give you the tools to cook, they force travelers into nearby restaurants. &nbsp;Pitcher-plant-style symbiosis.<br /><br />Speaking of carnivorous lures, I passed by a housing development populated by duplexes that seemed to be 80% garage. &nbsp;Of course: survival out here requires a car, even before food. &nbsp;Maybe even a truck? &nbsp;The day felt warm, but slush and ice were spattered everywhere. &nbsp;Stopping for lunch in Little Rock, I hesitated before stepping into the diner, until I was sure I wasn't going to be impaled by a falling icicle. &nbsp;The same latitude as Atlanta, but something puts an edge on the weather, something that demands four-wheel-drive and space to haul hay-bales.<br /><br />On the radio today, between Egypt updates, proposed budget cuts were discussed. &nbsp;A program that gives heating fuel to people who need it. &nbsp;That is, they can only afford a big house in the frozen wastelands where humans should not live unless they are paid (cf Antarctica, Alaska). &nbsp;Or else it's a family tradition to die in Maine. &nbsp;Or else they're welfare queens or whatever ridiculous straw-man we've come up with now.<br /><br />I can't tell if I'm still losing weight, or if my perceptions are being shifted ("expanded," you could say) by the people I see in the restaurants, the lobbies, the gas stations, the rest areas, and especially behind the wheel.<br /><br />Oh, right. &nbsp;All the rest areas in Arkansas were originally built&nbsp;segregated. &nbsp;Two sets of Male and Female bathrooms. &nbsp;Now they just keep one closed until it's time to clean the other one.<br /><br />Looking over my route again, I just calculated that Las Vegas is actually about half an hour out of my way. &nbsp;Hmm! &nbsp;Though of course if I went there, I might stay for more than one day.<br /><br />I still haven't made the phone calls I should. &nbsp;There's always tomorrow, until there isn't.
