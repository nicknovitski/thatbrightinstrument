Voter turn out, to hear people talk about it, is lower than it should be.  Why that is, again, judging from what is said on television and radio, is not known; the non-answer given is "voter apathy."  That's a description of the effect, not of the cause.  Why do so many not bother to vote?<br /><br />The mystery is solved by an experience of personal hardship.  I'm a registered democrat in Florida, so, as you might have heard, my vote just doesn't count.  Of course, I did not trouble myself to send in a ballot. <br /><br />People make a rational calculation of self-interest before voting.  Thanks to gerrymandering and the electoral college (and delegate systems in general), what your vote is worth varies <span style="font-style: italic;">immensely</span>, depending on where you live and what your political preferences are.  When the reward of voting is worth less than the time you'd expend to vote, then of course you won't do it, and of course, people aren't.<br /><br />What to do?<br /><br />What more needs be said about the electoral college, save that if you aren't angry about it, you must not know much about it either.  The thing that always baffled me the most was being unable to understand it's purpose.  Was travel so dangerous in those days that each state had to put together an expedition just to send word of their results to Washington?  Did the founding fathers, like the Johnnies whose education is supposed to mirror theirs, hate math, and thus needed nice and small numbers to count?  In a seminar on the Federalist, another student finally gave me a simple explanation: since more people live in urban areas, and those people might have a lot in common with one another even across the country, they would dominate national elections without some sort of counter thrown up.  If presidential elections were done by popular vote, then the weight of the coasts would completely overpower the sparsely populated land-locked states.  Of course, I immediately said "And what a wonderful world it would be!"<br /><br />Removing the college would require a constitutional amendment, which is difficult to manage in the best of times, which we are decidedly not fortunate enough to be living in.  However, you wouldn't need an amendment to instruct all members of the college to give their vote to the candidate who received the majority of the national popular vote.  So that's one problem solved!  Hah hah!  I laugh, because it isn't.  Actually, electoral college reform is a shockingly complex and well-studied topic, and difficult to maintain enthusiasm on or win votes with, so it's not clear that we'll ever see this nonsense resolved.<br /><br />Instead of saying anything about gerrymandering or redistricting, I'm instead going to point you to the <a href="http://www.redistrictinggame.org/">Redistricting Game</a>, because it will rapidly show you exactly how the current system is set up, and what should be done to fix it.<br /><br />You know, before television, voting days were big old parties, the biggest show in town.  The candidates would arrange for food and booze, music and entertainment, shamelessly trying to get people to feel briefly good about them before they voted.  People turned out in droves!  Admittedly, since the problem isn't voter turn-out, but voter not-having-a-reason-to-turn-out, having polls at the county fair and lining them with free food and beer provided by the candidates wouldn't really solve the problem.  Still, I'm going to call it Plan B.<br /><br />-Nick
