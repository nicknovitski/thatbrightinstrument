In short, my oral went well.  Extremely well.  My advisor, Mr. Tuck, attended.  I have it on good authority that, just before I entered the room with the committee and the process began, he had been complaining about the format of orals and questioning their worth as part of the curriculum.  I am further told that, once it was over and I and the committee left to take our robes off, he was speechless, in a good way.<br /><br />There's no higher praise I could possibly receive.  I think I owe it, at least in part, to the members of my committee, two of which I had to be introduced to, but all of whom had not only read my paper, but seen in it something striking and beautiful.<br /><br /><a href="http://docs.google.com/Doc?id=dhm89zgn_188g8tz9wcn">You may feel free to come to your own conclusions</a>.<br /><br />As a bonus, I include here the summary of my paper that, as <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2008-02-19-final-hurdle-before-graduation %}">my previous post</a> mentioned, I was required to present at the beginning of the examination.  I decided to skip over the chronological recounting of events that took up most of the paper in favor of a summary of the final positions of the characters, what Tolstoi intends by them, and my response to his implicit claims,<br /><br />That all sounds great, but don't expect to much: I fired it off in a hurry, half this weekend, half this morning.  It's disconnected, rambling, discursive, and equal parts cynical modern materialism and geeky starry-eyed transhumanism.<br /><br />I was too busy reading it off the printed page to notice at the time, but people in a position to watch the committee say that they <span style="font-style: italic;">loved</span> it.<br /><br /><i>Leo Tolstoi was a man possessed of prodigious insight and the ability to communicate it.  That makes him a philosopher, and he had something to say about philosophy, through the thoughts and lives of Andrei and Pierre.  If these two are meant to comprise all possible philosophic responses to Tolstoi's deterministic universe, then we must apparently choose between Pierre's humanistic cynicism, living and loving and happily enduring the faults and foibles of the ignorant, and Andrei's suicidal wisdom, pursuing full knowledge of everything at the cost of caring about anything.</i><br /><i><br /></i><br /><i>Both paths are marked by an atheistic acceptance of events as they happen.  I say "atheistic" since though both both characters' repeatedly reference "God" over the course of their respective revelations, that "god" is entirely absent, indistinguishable from "whatever happens to occur."  In this light, there is no path for the philosopher, no life of the mind, since what we think is a function of what we have experienced, and no god or will exists which can steer us one way or the other.  The course of our lives is just a mark of who we are, not who we would have ourselves be.</i><br /><i><br /></i><br /><i>But that said, just as the earth appears to be still, our actions appear to result from our decisions.  Until a science of psychology as fixed and known as the science of physics is discovered, we can only encourage each other to examine themselves and determine whether they'd prefer to relax and accept the simple joys around us, or to reject those joys and seek transcendence to some other, inhuman existence.</i><br /><i><br /></i><br /><i>What Tolstoi's philosophy seems to have gotten most wrong is it's ascribing to life and living things a boundless, unpredictable and unknowable infinitude of purpose.  This theory has become less and less likely as the physical, biological and psychic sciences have advanced and converged.  Much more likely has become the advent of a rigorous science of thought, not merely analytic, but experimental and synthetic.  When it becomes  possible to alter, and even create, modes of mind as we wish, then philosophers, people who have been trained to know themselves and others, to possess insight and communicate it, will be more crucially necessary than at any other time in human history.</i><br /><i><br /></i><br /><i>Despite this forgivable failure of imagination, Tolstoi has shown a way for the modern philosopher in the every-growing wilderness of knowledge: even in the face of comprehensive materialism, yet we may think, and live, and love, if that is what we wish.</i><br /><br />-Nick
