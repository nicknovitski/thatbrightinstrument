<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.eegra.com/comics/2008/05/34.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="420" src="http://www.eegra.com/comics/2008/05/34.jpg" width="300" /></a></div><br />In Russ Pitts' first article in years,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/issues/issue_210/6252-Time-to-Move-On">Time to Move On (The Escapist)</a>, he tries to tell hardcore gamers what's good for them. &nbsp;And good for him:&nbsp;I'm sick of subcultures full of people trying to make them exclusive clubs in the face of morals and common sense.<br /><br />But, I'm also quite sick of people pointing out this tendency in their particular subculture, as if it was the only one that suffers from it, or ever has. &nbsp;Why aren't there more people drawing the connection between the same phenomenon recurring over and over? &nbsp;It's the exact same pattern!<br /><br />(All due respect and consideration to Mr Pitts: he is the editor-in-chief of a magazine that is ostensibly about video games, so perhaps he has seen the broader trend, but only &nbsp;is only apparent.)<br /><br />Outcasts find something diverting. &nbsp;Their social awkwardness creates barriers between themselves and others, which both leaves them with time to fill and makes it difficult for them to explain the worth/fun of their hobby. However, When these similarly-adept outcasts inevitably gather, they find that they don't need to take any of the painful social risks of genuine communication with one another: they can just parrot the familiar terminology of the hobby, and enjoy the pleasure of recognizing that terminology, which recognition tells them <i>they are all part of the group</i>. &nbsp;Compared to normal socializing, this kind of Formalism is quite a deal, requiring minimum energy investment.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.eegra.com/comics/2008/02/18.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="420" src="http://www.eegra.com/comics/2008/02/18.png" width="399" /></a></div><br />In fact, it's so easy to make these sorts of "friends," it can become intoxicating, and frequently, toxic; when the condition of friendship is that you know the secret words, rather than say, you do me kindness regularly, it's much easier for your trust to be abused without you even realizing it. &nbsp;I'd say more, but the <a href="http://www.plausiblydeniable.com/opinion/gsf.html">Geek Social Fallacies</a>&nbsp;are already&nbsp;five and a half years old, so if all this is news to you, you have no excuse. &nbsp;The important thing, for this discussion, is that for all these groups, i<b>nclusiveness is a threat</b>.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I think my understanding of this requires a little background. &nbsp;I'm going to start by talking about games, partly because the article does and partly because it's a subject very close to my heart, but keep in mind that the arguments generalize out to all known subcultures.<br /><br />Some people are surprised at the way I talk about games (by which I of course mean <i>games</i>, not digital or analog games in particular). &nbsp;What little I know of human nature and behavior tells me that games are something fundamental to human potential: there are many different people, but for every single one of them, there is a game that they would enjoy. &nbsp;That, to me, is a complete no-brainer. &nbsp;What's also obvious is that not everyone has found that game, popularly called the "gateway" (a bit mystic-sounding for my taste), which will show them the pleasure which they didn't know they were forgoing, or at least, didn't know could be found in games. &nbsp;So I have earnestly tried to tell such people that such games exist, and to help them find those games.<br /><br />There's another kind of person I try to evangelize. &nbsp;They already regularly play a sub-class of games (or particular instance of that sub-class), and their experience has gone no further. &nbsp;Some folks have just done board games, or minature wargames, or running-shooting video games, or even pen and paper roleplaying games, or you-name it. &nbsp;Commonly, people from all of these paths already self-identify as "gamers."<br /><br />That's unfortunate, of course. &nbsp;Because consciously or unconsciously, they've identified "Game" as <i>whatever type of game it is they already play</i>. &nbsp;Few of them could avoid at least a small cognitive dissonance if they heard one another call themselves "gamers." &nbsp;"But they're not gamers," they think (and I've seen them do it), "they're just people who play Monopoly/Warhammer/Halo/D&amp;D!" <br /><br />Probably, such a situation will not come to blows. &nbsp;The disparate groups will express polite interest, but when each side finds that their clear signals, respective only to their particular game-sector, are misinterpreted or ignored by each other side, they eventually will disband and return to their separate caves. &nbsp;Insular groups are no threat to one another, because they don't need anything from one another. &nbsp;They're all self-sufficient, providing their membership with mutual social stimulation in the guise of a game, and it's attendant specialized language.<br /><br />Imagine now, if they were gathered them in a room, and I told them that, since all humans can and shall play games,&nbsp;<b>there is no such thing as a "Gamer</b>."<br /><br />Well, they'd ignore me. &nbsp;But whenever they couldn't, they would rapidly come to dislike me since, for all my talk of popularizing their particular hobby and helping more total fun be had, they know that I was pissing in their coffee klatch: I was invalidating the reason they had to be faux-friends, kicking out a leg of their ego-stool.<br /><br />So yes, I did, and they did, and we're all wiser and better now, except those of us who aren't. &nbsp;End of that history.<br /><br />Except I also did nearly the exact same thing with anime. &nbsp;"Come on, nearly everyone loves cartoons! &nbsp;And even those who don't inevitably do like <i>some</i>&nbsp;genre of televisual fiction, and whatever it may be, there's an anime that fits that taste! &nbsp;It's just like movies or tv in general...hey, in fact, what does the method even matter? &nbsp;And who cares what country it came from? &nbsp;It's just a vein of entertainment that most people don't realize their missing, but would enjoy if they could meet it on the right terms. &nbsp;And what a wonderful world that would be, when everyone could just watch whatever they liked..."<br /><br /><i>(I'd like at this point to link to the Gun Show that introduced the Anime Club characters, but comics are not as easily indexed as other web pages, so I'm going to have to stick with the general link and recommendation: </i><a href="http://gunshowcomic.com/"><i>Gun Show is a hilarious comic by KC Green</i></a><i>.)</i><br /><br />The anime kerfluffle was resolved more quickly, but to the same general purpose: if your identity hinges on membership in a certain social circle, and that circle hinges upon something fringe, then if that thing were to &nbsp;become normalized, something everyone does, then your group cohesure and identity are threatened.<br /><br />I'm still looking for a pithy way to introduce people to this idea. &nbsp;The best I've come up with so far is "If everyone's circumcised, no-one's Jewish." &nbsp;Because, as with many traditions of the ancient Hebrews, circumcision was a way of drawing a line in the sand around your patch of sand so you know that you and yours are different from the they who live in that other patch of sand over there. &nbsp;But maybe I just sound racist! &nbsp;<i>Anxiety</i>.<br /><br />-Nick
