As I mentioned <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2007-04-13-islands-in-street-introduction %}">before</a>, this book was borrowed from the Naval Academy Library, but not by me.  Yesterday, the person whose account it actually is checked out under asked me if I had finished it yet.<br /><br />"Uh.  Not even a little bit," I said.  I felt bad about this, since I hadn't spent the time on it that I had wanted to, since I had gotten really involved in making Earthwatchr and reading <span style="font-style: italic;">War & Peace</span>.<del></del><br /><br />"Well, it's due," he said, and asked if I could please turn it in.<br /><br />This has prompted me to return that copy, buy another for two dollars from Ebay (Hooray <a href="http://www.google.com/products"><del>Froogle</del>Google Product Search</a>!), and wrap up my summary and commentary for the first chapter, which had been languishing since a week after my last post on the subject.<br /><br />As far as format, I've tried to use the summary of the text itself as a skeleton on which to hang far-ranging, pie-in-the-sky speculation.  I don't want to get married to any particular mechanics until I've well and truly finished the book, but now is the time for brainstorming without an eye towards consequences.<br /><br />Fair warning:  This is long.  Read only if you're intrigued by the idea, and have time to sit and read for a bit.  Or know how to set bookmarks and read web pages over multiple sessions.<br /><br />Hey, some of my friends claim that they can't.  Or possibly, people who say they can't claim to be my friends.<br /><br />Anyway, each chapter begins with quotes which are awesome enough to include in full, even in this case, when I'm repeating myself in part.<br /><blockquote>To this war of everyman, against everyman, this also is consequent; that nothing can be unjust.  The notions of right and wrong, justice and injustice have there no place.  Where there is no common power, there is no law; where no law, no injustice.  Force, and fraud, are in war the two cardinal virtues. ... It is consequent also to the condition, that there be no propriety, no commission, no mine and thine distinct; but only that to be every man's, that he can get; and for so long, as he can keep it.<br /><div style="text-align: right;">Thomas Hobbes, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?vid=0joszX3cwBDDvWxTXAoDBt6&id=pYwNAAAAIAAJ&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;pg=PA1&lpg=PA1&amp;dq=intitle:Leviathan+inauthor:thomas+inauthor:hobbes&as_brr=1#PPR11,M1"><span style="font-style: italic;">Leviathan</span></a></div></blockquote>Based on the name I gave to this project, you might rightfully assume that Hobbes' work was in my thoughts when I conceived it.  It bothered me how forcefully people in my class rejected it, for emotional reasons which they didn't bother to examine.  I hypothesized a (ahem) genius undervalued in his life time, who was so frustrated by the world's resistance to the change that would be brought on by widespread adoption of his self-organizing nanorobot swarms, that he secretly launched a pod into space that gradually grew into his greatest design, a sentient space station that would, in return for the protection and opportunity it offered, force the inhabitants to address what it saw as the true nature of humans and human society.  Which bore some small resemblance to Hobbes'.   So it makes a place where, to get anything done, you need to band with others to make a microcosm of a state, or corporation, or gang.  <span style="font-style: italic;">Snow Crash</span> crossed with <span style="font-style: italic;">Logan's Run</span>.<br /><br />I suppose that, after I finish noting up <span style="font-style: italic;">Islands</span>,  if I wanted to really delay doing actual work on the game, I could re-read <a href="http://books.google.com/books?vid=0joszX3cwBDDvWxTXAoDBt6&id=pYwNAAAAIAAJ&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;pg=PA1&lpg=PA1&amp;dq=intitle:Leviathan+inauthor:thomas+inauthor:hobbes&as_brr=1#PPR11,M1"><span style="font-style: italic;">Leviathan</span></a>.  It's long, but there's plenty of parts ("On the Kingdom of Darknesse," say) I could probably skip.  Hobbes does have a systemic view of human qualities and conflicts that lends itself to the realm of games.<br /><br />Like, for instance, Force and Fraud.  It's a pleasing dichotomy, separating almost all human interactions into two distinct realms of ability.  They are excellent candidates for traits of some kind.  In fact, given the way they match each other perfectly, they could be two separate traits that can increase separately, or a single number in a range that one needs to roll above for Force (say,) and below for Fraud, thus making ability in one debility in the other, a la Ron Edwards' <span style="font-style: italic;">Trollbabe</span>.  Which I need to buy, someday.<br /><br />As well, this quote reminds me that I want cards to change owners frequently.  I never was very good at <span style="font-style: italic;">Magic: The Gathering</span>, but I watched a lot of games.  I noticed that the real game (that is, what determined victory and loss) wasn't the play you saw at the table, but the design of the decks, which happened mostly outside of the shared experience.  The result was: To be a successful player, you had to be a less entertaining player.  In a roleplaying game, this should be exactly reversed.<br /><br />To take <span style="font-style: italic;">shock:</span> as an ideal, development of the cards/deck should be linked to cool things happening in play, by which I mean success or failure of significant conflicts.  This rewards both action and fiction, and assists in attaching the player to the character(s).<br /><blockquote>The inhabitant of the United States learns from birth that he must rely on himself to combat the ills and trials of life; he is restless and defiant in his outlook toward the authority of society and appeals to its power only when he cannot do without it.<br /><div style="text-align: right;">Alexis de Tocqueville, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?vid=0_BaW-gWW5huGIXuOkzyZ9&id=e8IOEkLM6KsC&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;pg=PA1&lpg=PA1&amp;dq=intitle:democracy+intitle:america+inauthor:tocqueville&as_brr=1#PPA1,M1"><span style="font-style: italic;">Democracy in America</span></a></div></blockquote><div style="text-align: right;"><span style="font-style: italic;"></span><br /></div>I once vaguely described the conditions which Leviathan induces on his inhabitants to a curious friend.  "Like America, then," was the most memorable part of response.<br /><br />More to the point, one of my working mechanical assumptions currently is that conflicts always center around just two participants.  One player, the attacker, plays a card with a character on it and names a target, which is another player's card, either a character or property.  The defending player plays that named card.  Then, players take turns putting down cards that are in some way linked to the cards already in play.  In essence, individuals try to accomplish something, and ask other individuals whom they have genuine connections to, to help.  Past some number of degrees of separation, the friend of a friend is probably not worth calling on.  "The Police" or "the Government," being themselves gangs or alliances of gangs, are not to be relied on without the same  consideration of cost and value found in any other exchange.<br /><br />The summary of the text follows, indented and italicized, interspersed with reactions, commentary and speculation.<br /><blockquote style="font-style: italic;">Previous theories of gang phenomena are inadequate at explaining...<br /><ul><li>The behavior of individuals in gangs,</li><li>The behavior of gangs as groups, and<br /></li><li>Why gangs thrive or decline.<br /></li></ul>Jankowski's theory is composed of three principal parts:<br /><ol><li>Who joins gangs,</li><li>How gangs are organized, and</li><li>How gangs and other organizations and institutions interact.</li></ol></blockquote>Honestly, it wasn't Jankowski quoting Leviathan that convinced me I needed to read his book.  Reading these two paragraphs in google's search preview, I saw that his theory covered precisely what points I saw as required of a game that featured "gangs!" as a vague design goal. Namely, a determination of:<br /><ol><li>What the characters have in common, and what distinguishes them,</li><li>What gangs have in common, and what distinguishes them,<br /></li><li>How characters fit into and contribute towards the gang's shared goals, and how they conflict with each other over influencing those goals,<br /></li><li>How the gangs as groups conflict with each other, and</li><li>What strategies are viable in these conflicts<br /></li></ol><blockquote style="font-style: italic;">Why do gangs emerge?<br /><ul><li>Not, as most say, due to a desire for order or safety not satisfied in depressed neighborhoods.</li><li>Low-income areas are actually quite organized, specifically around competition for scarce resources.</li><li>Gangs are one possible organizational response seeking to improve the competitive advantages of its members.</li></ul></blockquote>It's possible that, if I were to generalize this game idea beyond the setting I've always imagined it in, other settings would probably be most vividly and immediately defined by first saying "In this world, what resource is being fought over?"  Money, respect, land, heismann trophies...each of these defines a world, or at least a dimension of it.  Since we can imagine the reason people might want those things, we can imagine the kind of people who would be fighting over them, and the ways they might do it.<br /><br />Imagine five people get together to play Leviathan.  They take out a sheet a bit like the grid from shock:, and each fill in one space in the first column, without any real consultation with each other, such that we end up with with the varied responses:<br /><ol><li>Courtly Power and Position</li><li>Longevity Drug</li><li>Commerce</li><li>Water</li><li>The Future of Human Evolution<br /></li></ol>It is a rule decreed from on high that <span style="font-weight: bold;">there are groups competing fiercely for each of these things, somewhere in the setting</span>.  These groups might be separated or conjoined in any number of ways.  That is, it is possible that the courtly inhabitants of the world duel and machinate to raise their family's position and coffers, both of which no doubt stem from some control of immortality, while secret cabals lurking in the background fight shadow wars for the right to decide the fate of the creature called Man, while fierce tribes in one forgotten corner war against each other and the cruel, uncaring desert for survival, with mutual unconcern between them and the rest.  For each game, or week or series of games, a single aspect is chosen to be spotlit.  "In this fictional world, people fight over all these things.  Any of them might influence this story, but <span style="font-style: italic;">this thing</span> is what we will be focusing on and fighting over right now."  The ensuing games focus on the battles to control that resource.  Victory in them entails the gang gaining more of that resource.<br /><br />Can resources be traded with others, and/or with the bank by a fixed ratio, Settlers of Catan Style?  Can a rate of exchange be tied to the way that, in the fiction, an amount of a given resource gives you more of another?  Commerce can get you water, but can water get you influence at court?  Should we just have, for each resource, an array [Resources this Resource Can Be Traded In For]?  Should we need to rank them, as in, one can be traded for any other, the next can be traded for any other but the first, and so on until the end?  Or is a web to be sought rather than a hierarchy, with Water being traded for the Drug, which can be traded for Evolutionary Future, which can be traded for Position, though Water->Position be impossible.<br /><br />Step 1: The above!<br /><br />Step 2: !<br /><br />Step 3: Dune!<br /><br />Note to self:  Work on step 2.<br /><blockquote style="font-style: italic;">Gang members have what Jankowski calls the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Defiant Individualist</span> character, a complex of seven principal traits...<br /><ol><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Competitiveness</span>, since as a child, he competed with siblings for space and affection<br /></li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Mistrust</span> or <span style="font-weight: bold;">Wariness</span>, since competition teaches him that trust is a calculation, not a given (though this does not inhibit organization)<br /></li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Self-Reliance</span>, since the assistance available to him is limited, and never without cost<br /></li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Social Isolation</span>, since emotional attachment is a hindrance to self-reliance, reducing his options and increasing the odds of getting hurt<br /></li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Survival Instinct</span>, since competitive environments make for predatory inhabitants, which he observes and imitates, if he wishes to survive<br /></li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Social Darwinist World-View</span>, since comparing his neighborhood with the wider world shows him that successful people tend to have the previous traits, lending him confidence in his rightness and fitness to survive and succeed<br /></li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Defiant Air</span>, both giving few indications of deference, fear or remorse, and having the private resolve to continue despite the obstacles and abuse they encounter, and any suggestion that are not up to the challenge</li></ol></blockquote>At first blush, there are two ways this list can be used.<br /><br />First, some or all of these traits might correspond to characteristics.  That is, players might accumulate Mistrust points, roll their Defiance or Competitiveness when in conflict with one another, be grouped in ranks or levels according to principles of Social Darwinism, or who-knows-what-else.<br /><br />Second, this can be the required structure of the back story for any character.  That is, the character's past must include, in order, descriptions of how he struggled with other children, how he learned that he couldn't always trust people, how he learned assistance always has a price, how he found emotional attachment to be painful or disadvantageous, etc.<br /><br />Of course, these two ways are not contradictory.  One is reminded of the phases of character generation in <a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://www.evilhat.com/?spirit">Spirit of the Century</a>, where each hero describes a part of his life, then selects two corresponding "aspects," which are words or phrases that the player can refer to in a conflict to boost his characters chances for success.  So a player might describe how his engineer-character spent a hellish four years in the middle of the Great War, but surviving against all odds, selecting the aspects "Trench Warfare" and "Surviving against all odds."  Now, whenever the expertise these aspects refer to might come in handy to the character, the player is allowed greater control of the narrative along those lines.  So, applied to the current situation, a player gives a couple of sentences about his character's childhood, and whatever led him to mistrust, and names a trait related to that specific kind and/or degree of mistrust.<br /><blockquote style="font-style: italic;">Variations in Defiant Individualism exist, and are linked to ethnicity.</blockquote>Perfect.  Clades, tribes, cultures.  In my opinion, <span style="font-style: italic;">Magic</span> was really boring before types and tribes and nations of creatures and spells showed up.  I remember reading an article (I <span style="font-style: italic;">think</span> by Rich Wulf) talking about how when the card game <span style="font-style: italic;">Legend of the Five Rings</span> was being developed, the various character cards weren't...well, weren't characters.  They didn't have names at first, just descriptions, like in Magic.  It was all "Headstrong Crane Clan Duelist" and "Ambitious Dragon Clan Soldier" and "Disgraced Lion Clan General."  But then the art came in, and they looked at it, and suddenly the descriptors had become personalizations.  These were people, not cards.  The designers knew there was a story behind each of them, even though it hadn't been written yet.<br /><br />I want guidelines for players to make cards with soul.  I want them to be alive.<br /><br />What is backstory, in <span style="font-style: italic;">L5R</span>?  It is that aspect of a card/character which is not determined by the player.  It is everything that is not "how you use it".  The characters live because we hear tell of their lives, we receive knowledge of their deeds as time passes, just as .  "Soul" and "Life" are words for "I believe this thing has motives independent from mine."  How would cards created by the players themselves possess that?  Characters live when some part of them is outside your control.  What part can be outside of their control?  Whose control would that part instead be under?<br /><blockquote style="font-style: italic;">Successful individuals rationally calculate...<br /><ul><li>Culture, both as an object to be preserved and as an action that dictates appropriate or desirable goals, and</li><li>Emotions, or the display of emotions, either as a resource or weakness, depending on the situation.</li></ul></blockquote>Jankowski seems to note this as a reminder for people who are unused to thinking this way.  It reminds me a bit of the "System Matters" essay.  That is, I can make the game I want by making rules that reward the behaviors I want, and require the situations I want.  So I probably would like to make a game where considering Culture and Emotions into rational strategic calculations is rewarded.<br /><blockquote style="font-style: italic;">An individual's level of Defiant Individualism is a function of...<br /><ul><li>The number of traits they exhibit, and</li><li>The intensity to which they exhibit them.<br /></li></ul>Most members of low-income communities share some of these traits (competitiveness, mistrust), but gang members will display more, and with a greater intensity, which is why they have joined the gang.  Successful gangs must manage this.</blockquote>I'm reminded of <span style="font-style: italic;">Trollbabe</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Polaris</span>.  In <span style="font-style: italic;">Polaris</span>, two numbers called Light and Ice indicate your ability in common action and lonesome action, respectively (if that sounds loosely defined, that's cuz it do be).  In <span style="font-style: italic;">Trollbabe</span>, you have one stat, that you try to roll over to succeed in physical tasks and under to succeed in magical tasks.  Combining the two, the more capable a character is in direct action, the more tenuously he is tied to the group, and the more difficult for the player to control, or at least get benefit from.<br /><br />It might be frustrating for real-life gang leaders to herd murderous, drug-dealing cats.  It should not be frustrating for game-life gang leaders to do the same.  Having your characters actions dictated to you, or not being able to dictate them, can be frustrating.  I think that this Defiant Individualism could be key to making the game flavorful, but it that it needs to be handled with some tact and discretion to make sure that success and failure are both interesting.  I presume, for the time being, a relevant number stat that all characters have.  When one influences another, the higher their total influence stat, the easier (less costly) the action is.<br /><br /><blockquote style="font-style: italic;">The definition of a Gang<br /><ul><li>It is an organized social system.</li><li>It is quasi-private, not fully open to the public.</li><li>It is quasi-secretive, with much information concerning its business remaining confined within the group.</li><li>Its size and goals have necessitated that social intercourse be governed by a leadership structure that has defined roles.</li><li>The authority associated with these roles has been legitimized to the extent that social codes are operational to regulate the behavior of both the leadership and the rank and file.</li><li>It plans and provides not only for the social and economic services of its members, but also for its own maintenance as an organization.</li><li>It pursues such goals irrespective of whether the action is legal or not.</li><li>It lacks a bureaucracy, an administrative staff that is hierarchically organized and separate from leadership.</li></ul></blockquote>Woo!  What a rush!<br /><br />We have, in this package, a fragment of a design document.  Why are social institutions not called gangs?  Obviously, due to the last two of these requirements.  Thus, one of my goals in designing a setting populated only by such groups, or giving guidelines for others to design one, must be: "No significant groups within in the bounds of play consider legalities a moral concern, and none maintain a bureaucracy."  By bounds, I suppose I mean "the setting, in practice."  That is, for a random example, imagine some kind of prison setting, maybe a planet or dimension or Underdark-like cave-system (<a href="http://www.spidweb.com/">Avernum</a> is the greatest CRPG you've never played) or something, it's reasonable to think that the maintainers of such a jail have some kind of  bureaucracy.  In which case, they have nothing to do with the action of the players.  They're not even backdrop, they're the brick wall behind the backdrop.  The world contains them, but the effective setting, the bounds of play, does not.  There should be a better word for what I'm talking about, since I've experienced multiple conversations where the word "setting" led to confusion, but if there is, I don't know it.<br /><blockquote style="font-style: italic;">Gang Membership is a negotiation between the Individual and the Organization<br /><br />The Individual wants to join because he assumes that chances of finding opportunities to improve the quality of his life will increase.<br /><br />The Organization only wants members of a quality and number such that it can maintain...<br /><ol><li>Its prestige,</li><li>The efficiency of its operations, and</li><li>The level of services to its members considered adequate.</li></ol>The ability of the gang to retain members is dependent on it's capacity to provide them with assets: Entertainment, protection, and monetary or material wealth.<br /><br />This capacity is dependant on its economic efficiency.<br /><br />This efficiency is dependant on its proficiency at...<br /><ol><li>Planning activities,</li><li>Mobilizing its resources (including human resources),</li><li>Creating new resources,</li><li>Executing its plans successfully, and<br /></li><li>Controlling its market (degree of monopoly).</li></ol>The ability to effect these things is dependant on its capacity to establish legitimacy in its authority structure.   This is done by giving the rank and file membership leadership equal to or better than their expectations, and an acceptable method of handling leadership change.<br /><br />The ability to establish legitimacy is dependant on its capacity to...<br /><ol><li>Manage its members defiant individualism, by imposing discipline but not control, and allowing individuals the freedom to pursue some of their personal goals, and<br /></li><li>Create cooperation through obligation, either through interest incentives (the individual feels he receives some return on his cooperation), moral incentives (the individual believes his gang participation is an agreement between him and the other members which he is obligated to uphold), and organizational rules (the individual understands and accepts a set of rules, either fearfully or rationally).</li></ol></blockquote>Did you follow all that?  If you look at only the first and last terms of the equation, you see that the success of a gang depends on <span style="font-weight: bold;">not</span> forcing ironclad control of your members, and on effectively rewarding them, brainwashing them, and/or systematizing rules and punishments.<br /><br />Is there a way for the points of contact between player and system to be ones of influence and not control?  All that seems necessary for that is for characters to have simple default behaviors which can be overridden via the expenditure of a limited resource.  Typically, the default behaviors of cards is to do nothing unless directed, and the number of directions or orders that you give is limited by your cards, not the rules.  So we want cards to do more than nothing, and for players to only be able to do less than everything (presuming this influence thing pans out, I mean).<br /><br />Lets say there are a fixed number of traits that character cards can have.  As with most card games, these traits each contain a special rule that applies to their bearers, overriding the default rules to their advantage.  For example, in <span style="font-style: italic;">Magic</span>, when one player's creatures attack another player, they either damage that player, or he selects one of his own creatures to be damaged.  However, if the attacking creature has the trait <span style="font-weight: bold;">Flight</span>, then they can only be "blocked" by other creatures with the same trait.  The rules are overridden.<br /><br />But what if those traits <span style="font-style: italic;"></span> contained both a favorable rule, <span style="font-style: italic;">and a default behavior</span>?  Every advantage would be linked to a disadvantage, a compulsion that, while it could be overridden by the expenditure of a leader's resources, could also be manipulated by an enemy.  Cf, Sonny Corleone gets killed because his reaction to certain news can be predicted.<br /><br />Despite my italics, this isn't really a new idea.  In <span style="font-style: italic;">Exalted</span>, or any of White Wolf's other games, there's a kind of trait called Backgrounds, which are each resources that the character posesses that are not inherently a part of him.  Secretly, this means that they must be managed: They can be stolen or kidnapped or tricked, they can ask you for help or favor, they demand respect or responsibility or attention.  The result is that the GM has an immense toolbox with which to engage the player.<br /><br />So what I would do is have everyone be the "players" of their own characters, and adversarial -type "GMs" to their opponents.   Whatever typifies those two types of play also typifies offense and defense in this theoretical structure.  Winning is a matter of learning how they relate and feed into one another.<br /><br />Well, it's a nice dream.<br /><blockquote style="font-style: italic;">Strong internal cohesion and efficiency is not sufficient to ensure the survival of a gang.  It must be integrated into both the local and larger community<br /><br />Local Community:<br /><br />Gangs must not only avoid antagonizing residents, but persuade them to consider the gang members "their own."<br /><br />To this end, they must be respectful in interactions with residents, avoid preying on them, insulting them, or harrassing them in any way.  Also, they must provide residents with help when the occasion arises, in the form of protection, manpower, giving financial assistance, or providing shelter.<br /><br />The gang depends on the support of the community if it is to be protected from rival predators.  It is similar to a local militia, in that it responds to the needs of the community, rather than taking a lead to set the agenda of the community.</blockquote>That last part gave me pause, at first.  I had imagined these groups as possibly being tribes, with a complete social system, or the crews of their privately-owned spaceships, not connected to any particular social system, and this suggests that they must always be subsections of some immediate community.<br /><br />But on further reflection, this is no restriction at all.  In any tribe, there will be some who drive conflict with other tribes, and some who provide a context or meaning for that conflict.  The crew of <span style="font-style: italic;">Firefly</span> might be a kind of sealed-off little world, but it still must survive in the real world around it, and that includes not antagonizing the people or powers of that world.<br /><blockquote style="font-style: italic;">Larger Community:<br /><br />This primarily includes linkages with<br /><ol><li>Local Government,</li><li>The Criminal Justice System, and</li><li>The Media.<br /></li></ol><br />People who operate within each of these institutions periodically determine that exchange relationships with gangs may be beneficial either to their ability to carry out their personal responsibilities, or to their organization's ability to execute the function it is charged with.<br /><br />They are of two types of such relationships, based on two possible origins<br /><ol><li>Representatives of one group initiate contact with the other with a proposition.  The chances this relationship succeeding depend on the type of service needed, the resources necessary from each party, and the track record each has in providing the service, or services in general.  Either way, in general, it will be temporary and not very stable.</li><li>The relationship emerges naturally when an institution or organization has consistent contact with the gang.</li></ol></blockquote>So, here is a way in which setting/system elements which are not, in fact, gangs, may be included in a game of gangs.  Or it's a way in which multiple gangs can have beneficial relations.<br /><br />Part of a definition of a particular group/gang/tribe should probably be "This is what we have more of than anyone else, and people who want it have to either make a deal with us, or just deal with us.  This is what we have to offer."  Even the poorest gang has an in with it's community, eyes and ears in places where others don't, an ability to move incognito, all of which others might want to make use of.<br /><br />If I decide that every groups has a traits that's beneficial to its members ("All members of Team Batman ignore the first x points of firearms damage!"  "All members of the Police Special Detail have their own car"), then perhaps it should be the same as the trait I just mentioned.  That is, what makes a gang unique has to be something it can in some way trade, use as leverage or collateral.<br /><blockquote style="font-style: italic;">To summarize:  Gang behavior and persistence is a function of<br /><ol><li>Inequality, and individual responses to reduce inequality,</li><li>The ability of the gang (both leadership and rank and file) to manage the desires and behavior of people with defiant individualist characters,</li><li>The degree to which a collective of individuals has been capable of developing a sophisticated organization to carry out its economic activities, and</li><li>The extent to which it has been able to establish ties to institutions belonging to the larger society.</li></ol></blockquote><br />So there you have it.  Mastering these four things means mastering the game, whatever form it eventually takes, if at all.<br /><br />Thank you so much, all you readers who stuck it out this far.  What do you think, too much at once?  I'm not 100% sure on the format.  Breaking each chapter up into sections that I can post once or twice a week might be much easier on both you and me.  If you have thoughts, please leave a comment!  Actually I'd love to hear people's opinions or ideas about any of:<br /><ul><li>The book</li><li>The game</li><li>This method of approaching them<br /></li></ul><br />I'm nearly done with <span style="font-style: italic;">War & Peace</span>, so it's my hope to finish the next chapter of <span style="font-style: italic;">Islands</span> well before the end of June.  Fingers crossed!<br /><br />-Nick
