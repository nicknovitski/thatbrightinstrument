margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">Comic relief quota met.<br /><br />Let me be frank with you: &nbsp;POCs are thin on the ground in the Blizzard staff, or rather they are, like the Air Up There, thinner the higher you go. &nbsp;The Diablo art panel was composed of a representative from each of six art teams, and each representative began his (of course, his) alloted time by sharing the names and faces of the team members who were not chosen to be outward-facing. &nbsp;I watched these faces carefully, because I wanted to confirm a hypothesis about the Witch Doctor.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br />One of the ways that the Diablo series&nbsp;distinguishes itself from the fantasy fiction games it heavily borrows from is via a bit of creative destruction of options. &nbsp;As in D&amp;D, players choose a "class" of hero at the beginning of the game. &nbsp;Unlike in freely described analog games, Diablo players are limited in how their hero presents, visually. &nbsp;In fact, they are restricted to a single look, without any kind of customization: All Barbarians are the same barbarian, all Amazons are the same amazon (and don't try to tell them that Amazons&nbsp;<i>are</i>&nbsp;barbarians), all Necromancers etc. &nbsp;But by keeping the player from throwing together "their own" character, the focus can be shifted: each hero comes from a specific, real place. &nbsp;"Barbarian" is a suitably generic name for a D&amp;D class (so much so that it in fact&nbsp;<i>is</i>), but the game tells you that these particular barbarians are from a particular mountain and have a particular (not very barbaric) culture, and legends, and why your barbarian is especially great and what he's looking for. &nbsp;And in Diablo 2, you actually visit the homes of some of the heroes, where everyone dresses like they did, and the circle is complete, and it feels as if each game is a mural in a temple to the fiction, the world which is in fact called Sanctuary, as if it were a temple, or perhaps each game is a book in a library we painstakingly put together, like inveterate plot dispenser Deckard Cain, or the ubiquitous archivists in each game who leave behind the quest texts and manuals and website updates. &nbsp;It might even be that each game is an immense yet lovingly careful brush-stroke on the canvas of our minds which will eventually compose an incredible tapestry...but I'm knee deep in metaphors and mixing up my creative mediums already. &nbsp;Tapestries have threads, not strokes.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br />The point is, classes were cultures. &nbsp;When we understood that fully, even those heroes whose homes had not been visited implied entire nations with the mere cut of their dress, the turn of their phrase and, inevitably, the color of their skin.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br />In the original <i>Diablo</i>, the Sorceror was black. &nbsp;<i>Diablo 2</i> similarly had the Paladin. &nbsp;In <i>Diablo 3</i>, so far, the One-Dark-Person quota is fulfilled by the Witch Doctor.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br />Both the male and female Witch Doctor models have a common look: emaciated, trembling as if with fever, ashy, mildly pot-bellied and scantily clad in the colorful, primitive raiment of their sinister culture. &nbsp;So poor, sick and dirty, in general. &nbsp;Oh, and black. &nbsp;I almost forgot.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br />Perhaps you see my problem. &nbsp;The phrase "witch doctor" (would "shaman" or "medicine man" have been too confusing?) is already fraught with racism, oppression, and nonsensical night-terrors of dirty, scary ethnic men in big masks with inscrutable powers of which we wot not. &nbsp;And the visual language used by the art team does not fight this impression, except to explain breathlessly at the end, "...and isn't it <i>awesome</i>?"</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br />Maybe. &nbsp;I don't think a thing being interesting <i>entirely</i> cancels out it being offensive. &nbsp;Or rather, I don't think anything should "cancel" anything, that all existences are complex, and no attributes are primary. &nbsp;It excites, which is good, and it offends, which is bad.</div><br />The Witch Doctor comes from the same strange new (to me, I suppose) racist place as the native's in Peter Jackson's <i>King Kong</i>. &nbsp;Jackson was playing into a slightly less typical racist narrative, a kind of&nbsp;Theosophic-nouveau. &nbsp;Skull Island, home of Kong, dinosaurs, and the mud-people (they are constantly covered in it, and seem to be made of it, as if they burst from foul pustules in the cursed earth like Uruk-hai), resembles a jungle at first glance, but almost every single geographic feature upon which that jungle grows is quite clearly a decaying building or an avenue or some other structure of incredible scale (though still, it's important to note, built with human proportions in mind) and detail. &nbsp;There was...a city? &nbsp;An empire? &nbsp;A civilization, without a doubt, proudly unfathomed by our histories, and yet, as the poem says "<i>Nothing besides remains / The lone and level sands stretch far away</i>".<br /><br />But no, that's not right. &nbsp;There is no sand, but a jungle, and jungle means "to rot." &nbsp;Life on the island is riotous, prolific, but bottom-feeding, craving an influx of new energies as that of the closed system dwindles from the curse of finite efficiency. &nbsp;This is late-stage life: vampiric, even qlippothic, too single-minded and pointless to be called "predatorial," macro-forms of the mindlessly feeding micro-organisms that live in our guts, skin, and eyes, loosed to feast upon our flesh and bones after some unknowable catastrophe felled the forces which kept them in check (white blood cells, or else giant gorillas). <br /><br />Thus, even immense dinosaurs will go to absurd lengths to eat a single Girl with a Head Full of Dreams, or a Firm but Fair Black Captain. &nbsp;Compared to them, we burn with a vitality that may see our civilization rise up the wheel even further, where they have already fallen. &nbsp;Kong's full journey eventually makes the message abundantly clear: New York is the New Skull Island, Skull Island is the Old New York, and people may decide for themselves, when all is pulled down to dust, if our heights truly equalled those of he who roared his defiance in the face of our Air Corps fighter planes.<br /><br />I'll stop myself and refocus here, because an analysis of King Kong could easily by my own post: the natives encountered are degenerate, their teeth, skin and minds roil with rot, just like every other part of the island, and they crave the pristine, in order to sacrifice it as offering to the forces of entropy, embodied to them by Kong. &nbsp;But they are the children of a people that once ruled their universe. &nbsp;Despite their apparent debilitation, they are physically capable, pole-vaulting stealthily to and from a ship moored far from shore. &nbsp;They are mentally tough as well, unfazed by things that we would revolt us...<br /><br />Sorry. &nbsp;I am trying my best to place this in the spectrum of racism, to explain why no harm was meant by it, and less harm was done by it than by, say, Resident Evil 4. &nbsp;Within the role the natives are to play, the fiction of Kong gives them power, significance. &nbsp;So they're more like Lovecraft's Asians than his Negroes. &nbsp;Gah! &nbsp;Sorry!<br /><br />So yeah, I was bothered by the Witch Doctor, but I eventually settled into an unsteady truce.<br /><br />Let's switch games for a moment. &nbsp;Here's a photo I took when I was wandering the art booth. <br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_4s_kbVFrc84/SpSriK1GrJI/AAAAAAAADNA/34VXs0m1Rws/s1600-h/IMG_0208.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_4s_kbVFrc84/SpSriK1GrJI/AAAAAAAADNA/34VXs0m1Rws/s320/IMG_0208.JPG" /></a></div><br /><br />As you can see, it's an awesome-looking brother with dreads and a rifle some kind of super-stealth suit. &nbsp;It's the un-post-racial version of Riddick, carrying around some trophies, mandibles or something from some alien scum he just straight <i>smoked</i>. &nbsp;As anyone can see, he's clearly a character of some kind for Starcraft 2; this was officially announced on Saturday as part of the voice acting panel, where the character's name was given ("Tosh," which leads me to believe that Blizzard under-values British localization), and where his voice actor was introduced. &nbsp;The two share an eerie resemblance. &nbsp;(No, not just because they're both black, they actually look related. &nbsp;Ass.)<br /><br />I was excited, at first, to finally see a second black man in the Starcraft universe. &nbsp;That one guy from the opening Brood War cinematic's been pretty lonely the past near-decade, since all of his friends look like this:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_4s_kbVFrc84/SpSsKO8gR-I/AAAAAAAADNI/xOcavUhGZvM/s1600-h/IMG_0209.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_4s_kbVFrc84/SpSsKO8gR-I/AAAAAAAADNI/xOcavUhGZvM/s320/IMG_0209.JPG" /></a></div><br /><br />(That's Tychus Findlay, redneck convict-conscript, a protagonist prominently featured in the <i>Starcraft 2</i> trailer.)<br /><br />(Before it's pointed out, I'm trying to ignore the possibility that this new black guy is actually the same old black guy, somehow having survived abandonment. &nbsp;If I believed that, I would halve the number of black guys in the galaxy. &nbsp;I'm pretty sure that's genocide.)<br /><br />But later I noticed something that had me much less excited. &nbsp;Almost depressed.<br /><br />Maybe you can't make it out. &nbsp;I know it took me a while. &nbsp;Go back up and look a little closer at the picture. &nbsp;See it? &nbsp;Right in the middle of his chest?<br /><br />It's a voodoo doll.<br /><br />All black characters yet announced in upcoming Blizzard properties (all two of them, or three, if the Traditional Physician counts twice, male and female) are scary voodoo people.<br /><br />That should bother you. &nbsp;Even if you're white, even if you have no black friends (it's okay to admit it), I think you should be able to recognize that this is a Bad Thing. &nbsp;If you are having a hard time doing so, you may be about as disconnected from the problems of American racism as the <i>Diablo 3</i> art teams. &nbsp;And certainly, it's no crime to be ignorant. <br /><br />But maybe they aren't just that. &nbsp;Look around at the faces on the convention floor. &nbsp;Thirty-two thousand people, flying to Anaheim to celebrate a game it costs at least twelve dollars a month to play, for months. &nbsp;If you had to guess, how many black folks would you guess I saw? &nbsp;If you had to guess, how interested would you guess Blizzard's fan base/target demo is in serious attacks on or deconstructions of racial stereotypes?<br /><br />In my experience, after "gay" and all its variants ("fag," "cocksucker," etc.), the number one insult in English-speaking online gaming is "nigger."<br /><br />Though in World of Warcraft and other games that persistently track tradeable accomplishments (in-game currency), the most scorn is reserved for "Chinese Gold Farmers." &nbsp;When the Taiwanese champion WoW players are welcomed in the opening ceremonies, the audience unleashes a storm of booing. &nbsp;They don't like them Asians, nosiree!<br /><br />This leaves aside the people who like to "roleplay" as Elves saying that they don't think the gods mean for the races to live together in such proximity. &nbsp;But let's not leave them aside. &nbsp;Let's make it really clear: <b>White Supremacy finds a comfortable home in World of Warcraft</b>.<br /><br />Sanctuary may be the ultimate suburb, Azeroth the ultimate sundown town. &nbsp;The concept of race is banished when uncomfortable and "real," but permitted when mocked, derided, shat upon. &nbsp;Could it be that way because Blizzard took cues from its fans on what was acceptable?<br /><br />Being bothered doesn't absolve or vindicate me, but bothered is what I was and am.<br /><br />-Nick
