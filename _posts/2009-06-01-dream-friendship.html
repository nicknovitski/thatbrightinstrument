The world was full of strange and inhuman things, and I was one of them.  I leapt from roof to roof, from power line to tree branch, and I could see and hear and know everything happening below.  I saw many creatures that fed on people, but I did not stop them; people did so much good and bad both that I felt unfit to judge those who hunted them.  If they killed for food, and I killed for the self-indulgent pleasure of feeling that I had done right...and there were so many of them!  They teemed in variety.  I could have traveled the world for a lifetime and never know them all, much less determine which of their lineages should be tolerated to exist.<br /><br />"I will cultivate my garden," I said, "Perhaps that will serve as an answer."  I found a park, and I set about making it known to all non-human beings within it that I would see them either leave, or die and be buried.  I had no noble reason besides my own will: it was justified simply because it was what I had resolved to do.  I killed several, because they underestimated me, and as an expediency for communicating to the others how sincerely in earnest I was.  Strange flowers grew.  Time passed.<br /><br />Suddenly, workers?  They were building something.  There was a hand truck, or a cart, piled with bricks and rebar, and the cart was marked with the logo of the corporation doing the construction and I've told this sentence backwards, because the logo was the first thing I saw, the image which made me suddenly be aware for the first time in...there was no immediate way of knowing.  Because I recognized it.  I knew that it belonged to an old and dear friend of mine.  He was making an addition to my park!<br /><br />I felt that he was nearby. &nbsp;It was a present, this addition, whatever it was (Flower planters? &nbsp;Statuary? &nbsp;Improved bathrooms?), in the world of our kind it served the equivalent of a distant wave or "hello," a signal of good intent and trust. &nbsp;We announce our presence when we wish to give others a chance to prepare, adjust or react to our approach, welcome or reject us, without emoting a threat. &nbsp;He had given me this, to see if I still remembered him, still considered him a friend. <br /><br />What a question! &nbsp;I ran to the entrance, the high and wordless arc of a wrought-iron gate breaking the placidly imposing walls of limestone brick.&nbsp; When I was installing it, I had wanted to discourage verbal communication, sticking to simple "Territory Claimed: Go Away" messages...<br /><br />In the driveway, a limousine.&nbsp; I rush to the rear passenger side window. &nbsp;My friend is in the car. &nbsp;I'm overjoyed to see him, and though he's much more reserved than me, he seems to feel the same in his own way. &nbsp;"How good to see you," I shout idiotically, then stop to realize the window hasn't moved. &nbsp;It's...reinforced, somehow. &nbsp;Smoky, it seems impossibly thick. &nbsp;To shout is ridiculous, because he can't possibly hear me while it's up, nor I him, so he doesn't say anything, just smiles ruefully and gestures as if in apology.<br /><br />I feel an outpouring of sentiment, nearly to the point of tears.&nbsp; He can't open the window; he can't even leave the car.&nbsp; His unique personal history has resulted in all the matter of this world hating him, attacking him whenever he comes into contact with it. &nbsp;Even coming this far in a fragile enclosure like his car is risk enough, so of course I forgive him, but he's still genuinely rueful. &nbsp;It hurts him to be seen like this: debilitated, unable to express himself properly.<br /><br />You see perhaps why I have such a high opinion of him.<br /><br />I am distracted. &nbsp;I forgot, in my haste, that the car would be staffed with people charged with defending their employer from vague threats. &nbsp;I am no longer accustomed to human communication. &nbsp;They are frightened by my appearance, filthy and threadbare. &nbsp;One has left the car and is menacing me with a gun. &nbsp;I spare a moment to try to calm him, but my attention is drawn back to my friend, who has started to clutch at his throat and chest in pain.<br /><br />Something's gone wrong. &nbsp;The car's seals have failed in some way. &nbsp;There's no time to find out more.<br /><br />I put one hand against the window, close my eyes, and <i>push</i>&nbsp;through without breaking it. &nbsp;That hand finds his. &nbsp;I thrust my other hand into the tilled and aerated earth beside the car and <i>pull&nbsp;</i>at the living-nature of the flowers, drawing it up my arm, through the twisted and pulsing center of me, and down the other arm, into him. &nbsp;It's as if I&nbsp;were siphoning gas, while at the same time processing and purifying it of it's hostility, infusing it with my wish to see my friend well and unhurt.<br /><br />I feel the bush above my hand collapse, whistling foully, under the weight of its sudden putrescence. &nbsp;The land roils outward from the spot of my impromptu prayer, spasming into rot. &nbsp;No telling how much I'll need, but I don't care.<br /><br />To fill our lives, we assemble these things, comforts, the various accretions of our efforts...but how can their value be compared with that of a friend?<br /><br />-Nick
