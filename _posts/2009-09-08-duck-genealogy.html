<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">I got this, of all places, in a post by Roger Ebert discussing the titanic discussion thread that latched onto his scathing review of Ben Stein's&nbsp;<i>Expelled </i>(he was making a point about evolution, which he &lt;3's very much). &nbsp;It answers all but one of the questions I have ever had (which one it abruptly and hilariously avoids) and also answers FAR MANY MORE which I have not.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_4s_kbVFrc84/SqagR8rU7iI/AAAAAAAADOI/ODD6VrxlDUU/s1600-h/duck+family+tree.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_4s_kbVFrc84/SqagR8rU7iI/AAAAAAAADOI/ODD6VrxlDUU/s400/duck+family+tree.jpg" /></a></div><br />The Ducks are the quintessentially white American story (regardless of whether Duckburg and related environs are located in America), with their Scottish, English and Dutch ancestry, mixed and entangled over the course of the hard-scrabble yet hugely enriching life in the new world.<br /><br />Looking over this ridiculous picture makes me (I know, I know) want to know the stories of the rest of the duck family. &nbsp;I suddenly realize there is no <i>Blackadder</i>&nbsp;RPG, to my knowledge. &nbsp;That is, a game where you play through a multigenerational series of vignettes that are unified by all the principal characters being descendants/ancestors of one another. <br /><br />(Yes,&nbsp;<i>Blackadder </i>is hardly the only example of the type of story I mean, but it has the double advantages of being funny and British.)<br /><br />Every game of <a href="http://www.lamemage.com/blog/index.php/category/microscope/">Microscope</a> I've ever heard of involved aliens, monsters and oh my, but nothing stops an interested group from having a "narrower" focus. &nbsp;That might be the one to try, but subdued, un-gonzo gaming may not be the specialty of my current groups. &nbsp;Then again, I wouldn't mind a gonzo multigenerational story. &nbsp;Something like <i>Accelerando&nbsp;</i>or <i>Legend of the Galactic Heroes</i>, maybe?<br /><br />-Nick
