Thomas Hobbes based his political philosophy on things he learned from his experiences during the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Civil_War">English Civil War</a>. &nbsp;You've probably heard the aphorism about life being "nasty, brutish, and short" (woo oxford comma!), but one section that struck me ferociously was...well, here:<br /><br /><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=2oc6AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA81&amp;ci=88%2C927%2C772%2C312&amp;source=bookclip"><img src="http://books.google.com/books?id=2oc6AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA81&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=3&amp;hl=en&amp;sig=ACfU3U3_asQdKlZUCLRTraLw5RdC9tn6cg&amp;ci=88%2C927%2C772%2C312&amp;edge=0" /></a><br /><br />That is, no one person is so big and tough that they can't be killed while they sleep, or by some team of five other people. &nbsp;That this was true in his life time, I feel I just have to take his word. &nbsp;Has it changed? &nbsp;Well, there's a good argument that technology disproportionately empowers individuals, especially individuals with good ideas. &nbsp;But there's an even better argument that, in Hobbes' time, casual violence, even murder, was prevalent to a degree most internet citizens would find incomprehensible. &nbsp;Warren Ellis (a expert on the subject if there ever was one, he said, rolling his eyes and smirking conspiratorially) once said that the person who wins a fight is not the stronger or faster, but the person most willing to permanently damage (not his words) another living, feeling human being. &nbsp;So I think that when you find people whose lives have led them to be unhesitating in the distribution of violence, they'll go through people who hesitate like tissue.<br /><br />But no, that's probably romanticizing again. &nbsp;You see, there's this meme in fiction&nbsp;(and certain related political parties) where the opposite is true: where some people are just better than everyone else. &nbsp;You see it all over the place, from the <i>Iliad</i>&nbsp;to <i>Die Hard</i> to all the animoos there are.<br /><br />I've been trained to see it as cool! &nbsp;How terrible is that? &nbsp;"Wouldn't it be great if some people could just take charge and run and jump and kill and there was nothing the norms could do about it?! &nbsp;But no, it'd be okay, because, you see, they'd be more real and cool and interesting and morally invested than the people/objects they would practice their will on!" &nbsp;I remember someone arguing for that interpretation of <i>Exalted</i>&nbsp;(an old favorite of mine) back&nbsp;in the old days when I went to forums, and I felt mildly ill from it. &nbsp;Well, sure, some games have characters that are fraught and challenged and <i>made to deserve</i>&nbsp;the gains they have, or else you're permitted to portray them as evil existences, and then it's gotta be okay that they can jump through buildings and be faster than a locomotive and whatever, right?<br /><br />But anyway, I think that "superempowered,"&nbsp;the word John Robb coined for the individuals and small groups who have far greater effect on large systems than you'd expect, is a good name for these people. &nbsp;So mote it be!
