I've authored a <a href="http://nwn.bioware.com/">Neverwinter Nights</a> module based on Akira Kurosawa's movie <span style="font-style: italic;">Rashomon</span>.  I have done this for two reasons.<br /><ol><li>I was applying to a <a href="http://www.bioware.com/bioware_info/jobs/positions/austin_writer.html">writer's position</a> at <a href="http://www.bioware.com/bioware_info/jobs/austin/">Bioware Austin</a>, and they needed an interactive writing sample using NWN.</li><li>I was in a preceptorial class on Kurosawa, where one option for our final writing project was to produce a treatment for a remake of one of his films.<br /></li></ol>I owe immense thanks to my tutor for permitting and fostering this project.  I will owe immense thanks to Bioware if they play it and hire me.  Fingers crossed!<br /><br />If you have an updated copy of Neverwinter Nights, please feel free to <a href="http://nicknovitski.googlepages.com/InAGrove.mod">download my module</a> and tell me what you think.<br /><br />-Nick
