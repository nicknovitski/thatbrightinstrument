I finally bought <a href="http://nicknovitski.com/">Nick Novitski</a> as a domain. &nbsp;It's nice to have an odd enough name that your first choice of brand is available to you. &nbsp;Although, if I were really smart, I would have gotten mylastname.com before that jerk in Texas did (just kidding man, congrats on the wedding).<br /><br />Right now, it just mirrors my new Tumblr blog. &nbsp;Tumblr seems like a pretty good platform. &nbsp;I'm not using the social elements to their highest degree, but there's a lot of good integration with other services and devices.<br /><br />The only thing missing is a tool to easily transfer my posts from here to there&nbsp;(though looking back makes me wonder if I really want to). &nbsp;Since I can download them as an XML file, though, I wonder if I could <a href="http://nokogiri.org/">write</a> <a href="https://github.com/mwunsch/tumblr">one</a>...<br /><br />This blog will lay defunct, but as-is, until I formulate a complete transfer solution, at which point I'll set up an automatic redirect. &nbsp;But in the meantime, <a href="http://nicknovitski.com/">nicknovitski.com</a> is my new home.
