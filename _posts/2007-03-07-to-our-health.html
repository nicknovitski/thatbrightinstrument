My father has played many roles in his life, but those who know him best will probably always think of him as a journalist.<br /><br />He is, very unlike me, exceedingly loyal, honoring the institutions that happened to pass through above others in their field.  <span style="font-weight: bold;">His</span> college, Yale.  <span style="font-weight: bold;">His </span>armed service branch, the Navy.  <span style="font-weight: bold;">His</span> paper, the Times.<br /><br />I've been raised to idealize it, so I'm always distressed when it publishes <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/07/business/07soda.html?ex=1331010000&amp;en=2fd77b42c89c43c1&amp;ei=5124&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink">an article that misses obvious points</a>. <br /><br />Basically, after first trying to discourage restaurants that use their syrup from serving tap water (unsuccessfully), and then trying to convince people that being in a plastic bottle makes tap water magically healthy (very successfully), Coca Cola corporation (and Pepsi and all the more intelligent competition) is now planning to market a new line of soft drinks fortified with essential vitamins and minerals.  In Coca Cola's case, they will be called "Plus," as in "Diet Coke Plus!" and "Sprite Plus!"  Which is so laughably and clearly ridiculous, the writer of the article tip-toes around calling them out for their short-sighted, arrogant, grasping greed.  Instead, he  paints a self-congratulatory picture of recent consumer awareness, that has made even those products that are the definition of unhealthy (Coke being associated with diabetes, obesity, addiction, osteoporosis, rotted teeth and engine degreasing) revise their recipes for our health's sake.<br /><br />First off, the writer is surprisingly unfamiliar with the origins of Coke for an educated person, much less a person whose job it is to be informed, in this case, about Coke.  Jake Pemberton was a patent medicine seller.  'Patent medicines' are what we jaded moderns would call snake oil, elixirs whose only virtue was their ability to project an image that capitalized on a health fad (more on which in a moment) and, credit where it's due, pemberton's patent medicine, a dark concoction of coca leaves, kola nuts, sugar and voodoo magic, was a great one.  "A valuable brain-tonic," his ad copy crowed, "and cure for all nervous afflictions!"  So indeed, sodas find their origin as a health drink, and Coca Cola marketed their drink as a headache(and other things)-cure for as long as they put cocaine in it.  Several sources misreport that as ending in 1902, when it was first reduced, only phased out entirely in the early 30s, and you better believe that every time one addictive ingredient was reduced in quantity, the other (kola nuts, or rather, by that time, their active ingredient, caffeine) was increased.  So, if the writer had checked his history even slightly, he would have seen that the business of soft drink makers has long been to make something unhealthy for us to toast our health with.<br /><br />Second, the image of our era as being uniquely health-focused is even more history-blind.  There have been at least two other such eras in the last century, though neither matched the mania of the last quarter of the 19th century.  Several stores in miami used to have wallpaper made from newspaper advertisements of the time, thick with promises of energy, clarity, attractiveness (none of which sounds familiar at all to anyone who watches television or listens to radio or looks at billboards, I'm sure).  Why were the Wright brothers able to finance inventing aeronautical engineering from a bicycle repair shop?  Because bicycles were immensely popular among the middle class, not for practical reasons (horses were relatively cheap in America), but for perceived health benefits.  The cheapest way to envision this era is to take a look around and mentally replace surgical and chemical cures with electric and herbal ones.  The less cheap way is to watch <span style="font-style: italic;">Road to Wellville,</span> a movie I once used to win the Kevin Bacon Game when the target was Dana Carvey (the other player tried to go <span style="font-style: italic;">Wayne's World</span>-<span style="font-style: italic;">Austin Powers 3</span>-<span style="font-style: italic;">Man Who Would be King</span>...the fool!).  The insanity of 'retreats' and 'rest cures' is captured, if not entertainingly, at least...existingly?<br /><br />Personal Anecdote:  The health craze effected change beyond America, and beyond patent medicines.  Around the same time, the St. James Brewery was using it's 'Guinness for health' campaign, whose effects persist in Ireland to this day. "Two pints of Guinness, a pound of steak and a fried egg every day," an affable bar-encrustation proudly vouchsafed to Hiro and I, "and they'll never be able to find anything wrong with you as long as you live."<br /><br />Anyway!  Sodas being bad for you isn't news either.<br /><br />From the New Chivalry - Health, published 1915<br /><blockquote>"My experience with coca cola shows that continued users of it are severely impaired in their digestion...In my opinion the consumption of coca cola, assuming that it contains the ingredients as shown by Mr. Fuller's analysis, would seriously affect the health of a normal individual..."</blockquote>From the New Dietetics (everything was new back then), published 1921<br /><blockquote>"Dr. Wiley has shown that coca drinks contain practically as much caffein as does the same amount of coffee .  They are simply flavored decoctions of caffein.<br /><br />"There are mischiefs in the soda fountain preparations which renders them even more dangerous than coffee.  These are first, the fact that they are always ready and accessible at any hour of the day and night.  Second, that they are generally supposed to be not only innocent of possible harmful effects, but through most alluring advertising are presented to the public as possessing most remarkable benificent properties.  As a result, not only adults, but children are induced to use caffein in the form of a soda fountain beverage, and in large quantities who would never use coffee in the same manner.  In other words, the public are beguiled.  Cola drinks are an insidious poison, the sale of which should be prohibited by law."</blockquote>Kudos to Google Book Search, who makes it easy to research things, even if you're not a professional journalist.<br /><br />I think I'll end this odd entry with something from the <span style="font-style: italic;">New </span>(!)<span style="font-style: italic;"> Atlantis</span>, so I can feel like I did some essay work today.<br /><blockquote>"We have drinks also brewed with several herbs, and roots, and spices; yea with several fleshes and white meats; whereof some of the drinks are such, as they are in effect meat and drink both: so that divers, especially in age, do desire to live with them, with little or no meat or bread.  And above all, we strive to have drinks of extreme thin parts, to insinuate into the body, and yet without all biting, sharpness, or fretting; insomuch as some of them put upon the back of your hand will, with a little stay, pass through to the palm, and yet taste mild to the mouth.  We have also waters which we ripen in that fashion, as they become nourishing; so that they are indeed excellent drink; and many will use no other."</blockquote>He invented <span style="font-style: italic;">everything</span>.<br /><br />-Nick
