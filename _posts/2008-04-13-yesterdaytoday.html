<span style="font-size: 180%;">Mourning/Remembrance</span><br /><blockquote><i>Fellow-citizens, the fourteenth day of April, 1865, of which this is the eleventh anniversary, is now and will ever remain a memorable day in the annals of this Republic.  It was on the evening of this day, while a fierce and sanguinary rebellion was in the last stages of its desolating power; while its armies were broken and scattered before the invincible armies of Grant and Sherman; while a great nation, torn and rent by war, was already beginning to raise to the skies loud anthems of joy at the dawn of peace, it was startled, amazed, and overwhelmed by the crowning crime of slavery - the assassination of Abraham Lincoln.  It was a new crime, a pure act of malice.  No purpose of the rebellion was to be served by it.  It was the simple gratification of a hell-black spirit of revenge.  But it has done good after all.  It has filled the country with a deeper abhorrence of slavery and a deeper love for the great liberator.</i><br /><i><br /></i><br /><i>Had Abraham Lincoln died from any of the numerous ills to which flesh is heir; had he reached that good old age of which his vigorous constitution and his temperate habits gave promise; had he  been permitted to see the end of his great work; had the solemn curtain of death come down but gradually - we should still have been smitten with a heavy grief, and treasured his name lovingly.  But dying as he did die, by the red hand of violence, killed, assassinated, taken off without warning, not because of personal hate - for no man who knew Abraham Lincoln could hate him - but because of his fidelity to union and liberty, he is doubly dear to us, and his memory will be precious forever.</i><br /><i><br /></i><br /><i>Fellow-citizens, I end, as I began, with congratulations.  We have done a good work for our race today.  In doing honor to the memory of our friend and liberator, we have been doing highest honors to ourselves and those who come after us; we have been fastening ourselves to a name and fame imperishable and immortal; we have also been defending ourselves from a blighting scandal.  When now it shall be said that the colored man is soulless, that he has no appreciation of the benefits or benefactors; when the foul reproach of ingratitude is hurled at us, and it is attempted to scourge us beyond the range of human brotherhood, we may calmly point to the monument we have this day erected to the memory of Abraham Lincoln.</i><br /><br /><div style="text-align: right;">Frederick Douglass, Oration in Memory of Abraham Lincoln</div></blockquote><span style="font-size: 180%;">Hope/Fear</span><br /><blockquote><i>There is no defense or security for any of us except in the highest intelligence and development of all.  If anywhere there are efforts tending to curtail the fullest growth of the Negro, let these efforts be turned into stimulating, encouraging, and making him the most useful and intelligent citizen.  Effort or means so invested will pay a thousand per cent interest.  These efforts will be twice blessed - "blessing him that gives and him that takes."</i><br /><i><br /></i><br /><i>There is no escape through the law of man or God from the inevitable: -</i><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><i><br /></i><br /><i><span style="font-style: italic;">The laws of changeless justice bind<br /></span><span style="font-style: italic;">Oppressor with oppressed;</span></i><br /><i><span style="font-style: italic;">And close as sin and suffering joined<br /></span><span style="font-style: italic;">We march to fate abreast.</span></i><br /><i><br /></i></div><i>Nearly sixteen millions of hands will aid you in pulling the load upward, or they will pull against you the load downward.  We shall constitute one-third and more of the ignorance and crime of the South, or one-third its intelligence and progress; we shall contribute one-third to the business and industrial prosperity of the South, or we shall prove a veritable body of death, stagnating, depressing, retarding every effort to advance the body politic.</i><br /><br /><div style="text-align: right;">Booker T.
