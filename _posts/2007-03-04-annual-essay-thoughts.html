After great pains, I reached a decision on a topic just before <s>spring break</s>essay writing period.  Francis Bacon's <span style="font-style: italic;">New Atlantis</span> is (or contains) an allegory for some kind of society of natural philosophers.  I want to use any and all reputable sources (the <span style="font-style: italic;">Atlantis</span> itself, plus the <span style="font-style: italic;">Advancement of Learning</span> and a bunch of essays) to expand on the idea of a Baconian college as much as possible.<br /><br />Mr. Schulman, typically, turned out to be exceedingly familiar with yet another program author I'm very fond of.  He was down with the idea.  It's a mixed blessing, of course, because he will immediately know if I<br /><ol><li>try to bullshit, or</li><li>am earnest but incorrect in my interpretation.<br /></li></ol>To this I say, no problem!   My task is one of extrapolation, and it's simplified by having a clear theory of what I'm extrapolating.  Richard Dawkins says that Theology is a non-subject (and don't get shirty with him, cultural anthropology, sociology, psychology, those are all subjects that have something real, namely religion, as their object).   Bacon, if he had the position explained well to him, would probably agree.   But then he'd say exactly the same thing about literary criticism, and nearly every other subject in the liberal arts.   To Bacon, the value of a story, true or false, is found in what practical lessons it can teach the reader, and <span style="font-style: italic;">that's it</span>.<br /><br />Think about your favorite Shakespeare play (if you even have one, you uncultured boob).  Now, tell me what it teaches the reader to think and do.  Now, if you manage to come up with an unambiguous answer, tell me how practical that lesson is, that is, how it enhances the (almost certainly material) good of mankind.<br /><br />I find it hard.  Which means that the inevitable question (even if treated implicitly), of what this program author would think of the program, will require a conflicted and tortured answer.  Don't you hate when figures you idolize for their focused ideology are found disagree with you on some other point you find important?<br /><br />-Nick
