The planets finally aligned such that Daniel, Nate and I could play some more of the adventures of Calvin/Mickey, Tatiana/Princess and Robert/Pyrosaur.<br /><br />We had a rough time resuming!  The economy of the game requires parity of the number of scenes each player gets, so it was somewhat important who's turn was it, and who was going to fight who on their next turn, but having taken such a long break, remembering anything but who sat to our left and right was basically impossible for me.  Luckily, better heads were present to help, but I learned my lesson; This time, I wrote down what the first three turns of the next session will be. <br /><br />I tried out two new wrinkles to the hack<br /><br />The first was the replacement of Dirty Tactics with Special Attack, resulting in two changes, one mechanical.  The first change is adding a step to creating the monster: Now you need a base animal, a color pattern, an unusual feature _and_ a special attack.  The other is turned out to be problematic... <br /><br />In Contenders, a boxing match runs round by round, with each player deciding ahead of time whether he'll fight carefully, heedlessly, balanced, or dirty.  Fighting Dirty gives you a mechanical advantage, with the risk that if your opponent wins narration for the round(base 50/50 chance, adjusted for how many more cards than you he has drawn), he can narrate the ref noticing the cheap shot and awarding him a free victory point.  Since the fiction I'm proposing doesn't really have a place for the concept of rule-breaking, I thought to make it simply cost a point of Conditioning.  Long story short, this seems to have been a mistake.  Right now, having spoken with Daniel (far better than I at game-system considerations), I'm going to try having it cost Technique next session.  Technique seems overpowered in the game, just like so many otherwise sensible dexterity-like statistics before it.  I'm not sure if this change will help things, but it'll be interesting to see what happens. :)<br /><br />This all reminds me, I intended to change the the boxer stat names of Contenders to more thematically appropriate fighty-monster stats.  Right now I'm thinking: Technique becomes Energy, your ability to use your awesome powers to control the action of the round.  Strength becomes Ferocity, the degree to which the normally reticent monsters have developed a killing/mauling instinct.  Cover becomes Resilience, the difficulty your opponent has in hurting you.  Conditioning (tentatively) becomes Konjo, the resolve to keep going beyond all reasonable limits.<br /><br />Anyway, the second alteration occurred to me during play.  Nate wanted to use a training scene to raise "Princess'" conditioning.  He said, "Princess is pretty fast, but she isn't big enough.  Tatyana buys a bunch of steak, so she'll grow big and strong!"  He was half-joking, as usual, but this clicked with an earlier idle thought I had about the place of "evolution" in the fighty-monster aesthetic. So I came up with this:<br /><br />Every time a stat is raised, describe a new aspect of the monster's appearance that appeared in the course of training.  This can be a change of color scheme, an additional tail, venom dripping from his slavering jaws, whatever.  Gradually, your monster goes from "it's kinda a dinosaur" to "it's a 20-foot tall dinosaur with spikes on its tail and cannons on its back and etc." <br /><br />We're only maybe a session away from endgame (damn Daniel and his successful fighting!), so we probably won't see this come into effect very much.  In fact, we've only had two or three training scenes each in the game, so maybe this evolution stuff will have too little effect to be worth it.  Still, I think I like the idea of the monsters starting off as childhood companions, then gradually growing into the role of fighting-thingys.<br /><br />Playability note: Nate had difficulty deciding on changes to his monster (at first he tried to just say, again and again, that she got bigger).  This is part of a pattern: Not being sure what the monster's base design would be, not being sure what her special attack would be, etc.  When Daniel and I suggested possibilities, they didn't appeal to him, so it wasn't just a case of disconnect...I think lots of people can have that problem, but I don't know how to solve it yet, except with a long list of possibilities/examples.  That might be enough, but I'm not sure.<br /><br />We shall see!<br /><br />-Nick
