The Maryland Legislature recently passed a bill expanding the 6% sales tax to include computer support services, data center support, custom programming, consulting, and disaster recovery services.<br /><br />Bad news for anyone living in Maryland thinking of getting a job as/at an IT services provider.  True, some of your clients will now want to hire you to work in house rather than retaining you as an outside specialist, but you still loose job security, and value will be allocated less efficiently. <br /><br />Working for a company that provides a specialized service to other companies is kinda like having a tiny little union that doesn't try to hide it's corruption from you.  I was thinking kindly on the prospect, but now, I'll have to cut out a beneficial middleman.<br /><br />Or move to DC, which is what I was planning, and where many other IT offices will no doubt consider joining me.<br /><br />-Nick
