We read several of Plato's dialogues at my zany school, but not all, or even most of them.  One which we don't read, <span style="font-style: italic;">Clitophon</span>, is an interesting outlier from the usual narrative of "someone challenges Socrates, Socrates asks what they mean, hours pass, challenger realizes the hidden weakness of his position."  It starts with Socrates remarking, apparently in passing:<br /><blockquote>"We have recently been informed that Clitophon the son of Aristonymos, in discussion with Lysias, has been criticizing the conversations and speeches of Socrates, while greatly praising the instruction of Thrasymachus."</blockquote>Very conversational and relaxed in tone.  But in a shocking twist, it turns out the eponymous gentlemen is actually there(?), and immediately leaps to defend himself from a perceived attack, saying:<br /><blockquote>"Whoever told you that, Socrates, misrepresented what I said to Lysias about you.  Though it's true that I didn't praise you for some things, I did praise you for others.  Since you're obviously scolding me right now, though your pretending you don't care, I'd be very glad to tell you myself what I said - especially since we happen to find ourselves alone - so you won't so readily suppose that I have anything against you.  In fact, you probably didn't hear the truth, which is why I think you're being needlessly hard on me.  so if you'd let me speak freely, I'd gladly do so - I want to tell you what I said."</blockquote>He sounds quite unnecessarily defensive, and I imagine that (and here is where you may inform your meat-computer that the preface is ending and the significant part, such as it is, begins) it is with sadness and reassurance in his tone that Socrates replies:<br /><blockquote>"By all means; it would be shameful for me not to submit to you when your intention is to help me; for clearly, once I know my good and bad points, I will make it my practice to pursue and develop the former while ridding myself of the latter to the extent that I am able."</blockquote>Criticism, when accurate, is a favor, and when inaccurate, is nothing.  For too many, criticism has only ever been experienced as a tool for hurt, used by the frustrated, bored and insecure.  Sterile and impotent puppy-kicking.  Now those people live in a world where the slightest correction, the merest hint of assistance is interpreted as a crime, an attack, an unprovoked assault on the self-image and self esteem.  Because as they were raised, criticism came only without productive purpose, now they are incapable of imagining it purposeful.<br /><br />I wish that this way of treating developing humans could be prosecuted as a felony.  But failing that, we can always laugh those cruel, useless criticizers into humiliation-locked isolation, and act with honest compassion to those capable of being saved.<br /><br />Kant said (or didn't, there's some disagreement) that one of the things that all humans owed each other was complete honesty at all times; that there was no possible circumstance when you had a "right" to lie.  Which is silly.  Let us instead say that, to those people towards whom we feel compassion, with whom we feel we suffer together, we have no right to lie.  Compassion is always honest.<br /><br />(The easiest accusation for me to anticipate being leveled at this formulation is that it is insensitive to people's feelings.  That's possible.  I could respond that criticism is voiced best when something more important than sentiment is on the line, but I'm not yet entirely sure whether there is such a thing (another post some day?).  I am sure that I personally don't feel that people who criticize me, whether accurately or inaccurately, cause my feelings to be "hurt."  This leads me to suspect that such reactions in others are learned, rather than innate, and can thus be unlearned with careful (compassionate!) encouragement, but I suppose we'll have to see.)<br /><br />-Nick<br />PS: The worst temptation of the blog (which I have thus far avoided) might be to write there what would be better said to the people they concern.  :)
