<a href="http://www.somethingawful.com/articles.php?a=3981">Something Awful punctures some of my Ineractive Fiction fannishness.</a><br /><br />I admit it.  Even ignoring the less-good examples of the form that the article is mocking, trying to determine <span style="font-weight: bold;">and</span> use a limited set of programmed interactions is not everyone's idea of fun.<br /><br />Let us presume a game of a sufficiently defined and determined nature, such that everyone who reads the book has the same understanding of what you do when you play.  In any given situation that is open to player input, all the available options have to be mentally parsed.  I've seen play break down here several times, especially with new players and systems with lots of options.  Some people will remember the classic example: "Can I cast a spell?  I want to cast...magic missile!  I attack the darkness!"  Etc. <br /><br />Of course, it's not a phenomenon limited to D20.  If you're going around the table for scenes in PTA, you're really asking for a choice from an indefinite option set.  Confronted with the need to come up with something on the spot, some people are going to wish they had a list to choose from, even if it was a long one.<br /><br />But the real problem is that no one comes to the table equally.  Even presuming everyone at the table read all the way through the book (hah!), they've had different experiences with different games before this one, and that's what's going to influence their expectations more than anything else.  The D20 family of products capitalizes on this, or at least attempts to.  In contrast, indy games sometimes remind me of board games, with their widely divergent types of play.  Inasmuch as they are games of the same sort, playing Risk should teach you how to play Settlers of Catan, but how?  It seems like it would only inform behavior.  That is, a man who played nothing but Risk most of his life might, confronted with Settlers, look to those elements apparently held in common (resources collected, little colored pieces of wood) and tend to expand aggressively.  He's not stupid (not if he's good at Risk!), and he knows that Settlers is a different game, but he's not as familiar with it as he'd like to be, and if he doesn't see a way to apply his practiced behaviors in this new rules environment, he's going to get just as anxious and frustrated as someone new to the game.<br /><br />But this isn't the only possible reaction.  The first time my mother played Settlers of Catan, about two years ago, she jokingly groused how little she understood of it.  The whole way though the game.  Right up till when she won.<br /><br />No, I'm not bitter.  Yes, I'd still like a rematch.<br /><br />Anyway, a game, as a social setting, carries an implicit social threat.  A new game is like the first day of school: Plenty of people can't help but see the whole experience as series of minefield to navigate.  People get pretty worried about doing things <span style="font-style: italic;">wrong</span>. Someone in the group probably knows the game better than they do, and if you're playing with these people, you probably like them a little and care whether they like you a little.<br /><br />And with caring comes <span style="font-weight: bold;">fear</span>!<br /><br />I think this fear is what prompts behavior contrary to the stated intent of a 'new' game.  We try to fall back on behaviors whose success we've experienced, however inappropriate.  To avoid this and properly approach a game, you have to be game.  You have to be de-invested in your performance.  You have to be, like the Fonz and my mother, always cool.<br /><br />So the next question is, how to encourage this state in players?
