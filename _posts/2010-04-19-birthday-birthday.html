Yesterday, my age incremented as I completed my 28th year.<br /><br />On the drive back from Atlantic City, I spoke to James, a friend with the same birthday (and birth-year). <br /><br />He said he recalled that, when we played Street Fighter 3 back in college, I liked playing as this guy.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://media.strategywiki.org/images/2/29/SFA3_Yun.gif" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://media.strategywiki.org/images/2/29/SFA3_Yun.gif" width="164" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Yun: skateboarding, baseball cap-wearing teenage kung-fu savant.</td></tr></tbody></table>It's true! &nbsp;Even though there were multiple endearing characters in the game, Yun was my favorite. &nbsp;He gave the impression of being incredibly easy-going, until the exact moment when he wasn't. &nbsp;As the fight began, his normally relaxed posture would contort and coil into the steel spring you see above, and when his moves were unleashed, they were balletic in their needle-like precision in the application of force. &nbsp;And the clothes! &nbsp;You can't tell as much without his skateboard, but this guy was Hong Kong come to life, where the august traditions of history meet the vibrant energy of youth. &nbsp;Everything hopeful and awesome about Asia.<br /><br />James said that there was that one move of his that I liked the most, that I called "Movement Without Stepping."<br /><br />It's true! &nbsp;Though by current standards my education in martial arts fiction had barely begun, I was already enough of a snob/enthusiast to feel as if I recognized the move in question: Yun (as pictured above) would throw a left straight while simultaneously pushing forward off his right foot to make a step/skip/leap that at the higher levels could cross the screen at speed (apparently, Yun's achilles tendon is the <i>strongest</i> part of his body). &nbsp;I forget where I got the name, but it seemed right; a paradoxical phrase seeming to refer to a logical impossibility, in fact referring to a flabber-ghasting level of physical development. &nbsp;See also: the No-Shadow Kick, the Iron Vest, etc.<br /><br />Saying all this, James further said "That's what I notice about you: you move, but you step too much."<br /><br />I needed a few moments to take that in before the conversation could continue.<br /><br />Later, he asked me if I had any birthday resolutions (apparently, without discussing it, we had both thought it made more sense to consider ones own birthday as a "new year," rather than January first). &nbsp;I said, "Yeah, to become independently wealthy."<br /><br />So let's see how that goes.
