[The last essay of 2006.]<br /><br /><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 85%;"><span style="font-style: italic;">And let [the reader] be persuaded for himself that we have not written in the spirit of introducing new things, but of correcting depravities that at some time we hope to see corrected at last.</span></span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 85%;">-Benedict Spinoza, <span style="font-style: italic;">Theologico-Political Treatise, </span>14.2.5</span></div><span style="font-size: 85%;"><br /></span><span style="font-size: 85%;">Spinoza claims that "<span style="font-style: italic;">freedom of judgment is a virtue, not to be suppressed.</span>" (20.4.18)  The Free Republic, in which everyone is permitted to think whatever they wish and say whatever they think, has a quality perfectly positive; Any Republic which falls short of that standard is reduced in goodness and, eventually, longevity.  In the best republic, there is freedom of worship.  However, the Free Religion, in which everyone is bound to the dictates and commands of the leaders of the republic, is also mandated; Religious leaders have no right to tell people what would be good and right action.  "<span style="font-style: italic;">The exercise of piety has to be accommodated to the peace and utility of the Republic and, consequently, be determined solely by the highest powers, who thus must be its interpreters as well.</span>"  (19.1.2)  So in the best religion, there is freedom of obedience to the republic.  To allow this free pass to the state, Spinoza restricts the power of priests to encouraging 'true' Religion, defined as "<span style="font-style: italic;">a simplicity and truthfulness of spirit,</span>" which cannot be "<span style="font-style: italic;">infused in human beings by an imperium of laws, nor by public authority.</span>  <span style="font-style: italic;">Further, absolutely no one can be compelled by force or by the laws to become blessed; but for this are required pious and brotherly admonition, good education, and, above all, one's own free judgement." </span>(7.11.45-46)<br /><br />Thus the most free and stable Republic and Religion are defined, and defined such that there is no conflict between them.  But however neatly defined, this unity is entirely impossible.  No Republic that acknowledges scripture or revelation can help but suffer at their hands.  Since the original Republic's noble lie, there have been a great many attempts to design the perfect state.  But, as in the original, inherent in the Republic of Spinoza's treatise is the seed of its own destruction.  Both in its theology and government, it cannot hope to face or control the beliefs which it readily allows and even invites into its citizenry<br /><br />Spinoza explains convincingly that his god never acts except through second causes.  Which is to say, his philosophy is a naturalist one, opposed to the supernaturalists, who believe that gods (and/or wizards and fairies) cause actual magics or miracles, temporary exceptions to the otherwise omnipresent natural law.  According to a naturalist, all material things have material causes, investigable by reason.  That such a thing is possible, Spinoza credits to his god.  But he is nearly alone in this.  Naturalists familiar with physics and biochemistry of extant learning eventually find that they have no need to hypothesize any god to explain anything they encounter.  Spinoza is advancing a philosophy that tends to make its honest adherents eventually abandon it.<br /><br />By their nature, ideas are no less subject to natural selection than living things.  If the expression of a gene makes it less likely for its host to live long and to replicate that gene (perhaps , nature will select against it.  As generations pass, there will be fewer and fewer bearers of that gene.  Likewise, if the expression of some idea makes it less likely for its host to survive and/or spread it to others (perhaps some risky entertainment like cave diving, or a song only pleasant to a few people), then fewer heads will hold it as time goes passes.  In this view, an idea or group of ideas that simply spreads from person to person without changing their behavior much can be thought of as a typical virus, while a more complex interlinked collection of ideas that organizes people into a group is a like the genetic code of an animal, organizing multiple cells into an adapted body.  Religions, inasmuch as they organize societies, can be thought of as gene complexes of this sort, and the religious institutions they cause to be built can be thought of as animals.<br /><br />Any recognizable religion must include a broad variety of genes.  Most centrally, if we would even call it a religion, it must include positive supernatural claims, such as the existence of certain god or gods, and descriptions of their attributes, behaviors, and histories.  Beyond this, it includes genes which instruct its cells to indoctrinate their children, or even strangers, ensuring the animal's growth.  Other genes make cells to only coexist peacefully with other cells of the same animal, to encourage self-definition and violent dominance.  And some genes warn cells to mistrust free-floating idea viruses which will add new genes to the code.  Principles of dogmatic absolutism are like the genes of an immune system, making both the people who hold them, and the religions which inspire them, resistant to infection.<br /><br />Spinoza's Free Religion, though not hazardous to the individual cells that carry it, does leave them extremely vulnerable to infection with a "no gods at all" virus, which makes it highly unlikely to survive, or at least, to survive as a religion.  Dogmatic religions which would make their adherents reject and avoid any evidence which invalidates their beliefs, are far more vigorous and likely to continue to "live."<br /><br />But of course, the Free Religion does not have to support itself against its competitors.  The Free Republic, which permits no other group to interpret scripture, effectively permits no other religions to coexist with it except the Free.  Indeed, they are so intertwined that they are, in the eyes of those religions barred from their practices, a single thing, an inverse-theocracy, a true state religion.  However they (or we) might be leery of that idea, Spinoza argues that it is the only kind of religion that can be truly functional.<br /><br /></span><br /><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 85%;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If someone now asked, however, what if the highest power commanded something contrary to religion and to the obedience that we have promised god by an express compact? - Is the human imperium to be complied with, or the divine?  But since I will deal with these things at more length in the following, here I only say briefly that, when we have a certain and indubitable revelation, God is to be obeyed above all.  But since human beings usually err in the greatest degree about religion and in view of the diversity of their mental casts fantasize many things with great contentiousness, as experience testifies more than enough, it is certain that if no one is bound to comply with the highest power in those things that he deems to pertain to religion , then the right of the city would depend on each's different judgement and emotion.  For no one who judged a statute to be contrary to his own faith and superstition would then be bound by it; and so, under this pretext, each could assume a license for everything.</span><br /></span></div><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 85%;">(16.8.17-19)<br /></span></div><span style="font-size: 85%;"><br />And certainly, they do.  In our own country, there are not insignificant numbers of people who claim, in apparent seriousness, to have communication and/or commerce with the supernatural beings they worship.  In some cases, the actions of tens of thousands of people are determined by these messages from the beyond.  Not infrequently, commands are received from these beings, or individuals who speak for them, which are contrary to broadly accepted social norms.  In cases of conflict, very few of these worshipers would say that the authority of their government somehow supersedes that of their invisible masters.  As Spinoza explains, what people should do is to sceptically examine any such commands, wondering if their physical or mental failures are more likely than their being singled out as the bearer of an important message.  He also explains that the regularity and continuance of natural law results from divine will.  Thus, all things happen both because they are materially caused, and because they are what the appropriate god wills.  Whatever happens, happens by divine right.  Thus, his Republic claims the right to interpret scripture not merely as a practical concern, but also equates that practical control with a god-granted one.  It accepts into it's midst supernatural beliefs, appropriating them as a pillar of state, seeking to co-opt the hallucinations of its less self-examining citizens, and to put competing religious leaders out of business.<br /><br />Unfortunately, like genes and languages, religions naturally diverge.  Those which survive for any appreciable length of time do so because they counteract this tendency in some way.  For instance, not all proclaimed Catholics have the same beliefs or act the same way, but their doctrine establishes a centralized authority with the right to command and judge those beliefs and actions.  As long as there is a rigid structure-within-a-structure calcified at the heart of their religion, there is no question as to its coherency.  Their divergent believers can always be brought back to the apparently unified whole, or at least, defined in terms of it.  The power and continuity of the Vatican are mechanisms that exert a cohesive force, which makes them tend to create fewer "offspring" religions than otherwise.  Unlike with animals, there seems to be few practical limits to the size of religions, so having more children is not to their advantage; The fewer religions there are, the less competition there is for the resources they need.  If a religion has a less powerful collective force, then it has more children, which we would call more factions or sects.  As factions multiply, new and more vigorous offspring might take most or all of the worship of its more stolid parent.  Even if the state religion proposed in the treatise comes to be established, it does not have a strong centralizing force.  Though the government has the power to interpret scripture and legislate sacredness and to require participation in some rituals and disbars, Spinoza insists on granting each citizen, no matter how prone to delusion or lacking in reason, the right to believe what he likes and say what he believes.  That is, to think divergently, and to spread his divergence to others.  The Vatican can denounce worshipers for saying the wrong thing, which inhibits the spread of infectious ideas, as explained earlier.  Absolutist dogma prevents both the change and the multiplying of religion.  But unlike Catholicism, the Free Republic, free of both a mechanism for limiting offspring and of limiting infection, is a hothouse, a breeding ground for faction.  Anyone with a convincing enough story of a god telling them what to do will be able to spread it and, inasmuch as it spreads, to claim superiority to the story of the Republic.<br /><br />It is not only inevitable that such a state would eventually give rise to groups of citizens who believed that their interpretation of or communication with the invisible was superior to the Republic's ways.  It is also inevitable that some of those groups would be of a mind to overthrow it, and it is further inevitable, as long as the conditions permitting their possibility exist, that one such group will succeed.  It seems as if to claim that the state's power devolves to it from anything outside or above it is a recipe for disaster, as rebels compete to take that mantle of divine right onto their multitude of causes.</span><br /><span style="font-size: 85%;"><br /></span><br />[Using memetic theory without referring to outside texts proved a lengthy way to go.  Still, I'm more or less happy with how this turned out.]
