Detroit fans shouldn't be too disappointed: better that Roethlisberger throw two picks, and therefore the game, than he get yet another entirely undeserved ring. &nbsp;Now we can finally throw him under the bus, right? &nbsp;And once that's over with, we can talk about your sickening dependence on moribund for-profit companies that are destroying America, and how they think this is the economic moment to spend your benefits checks on Eminem and the most expensive advertising spot in the world to promote Detroit <i>as a luxury brand</i>. &nbsp;Luxury?! &nbsp;If you offer a car "imported from Detroit," it better be from our feral-city future. &nbsp;It better have all-wheel drive, armor plating, a flamethrower, and be driven by Robocop.<br /><br />My Menu for the evening was primarily Buffalo Chicken Meatza (dark meat, stir-fried, store-bought sauce), with mozzarella,&nbsp;parmesan and bleu cheeses. This went over well. &nbsp;We also had some extra mozzarella, so I cooked bacon and made some dead-simple quesadillas from low-carb tortillas. &nbsp;Cooked in the pan with a dash of olive oil (we didn't have a neutral one), they tasted like fucking pancakes. &nbsp;Fuck you, Taco Bell.
