Part of <a href="http://brainoverbrawn.com/">the cool thing I'm doing now</a> is reducing my carbohydrate intake. &nbsp;After a period of adjustment, I decided to reduce it even further. &nbsp;It certainly has helped me loose weight without doing any exercise besides pacing when on the phone.<br /><br />Though that isn't enough. &nbsp;Resistance training is the missing piece. &nbsp;A good man once said "If you're 6'2", and 215lbs or less, you don't need a weight loss program, you need a 'get strong enough to fight bears' program."<br /><br />At any rate, the low-carb approach is helping me discover all kinds of strange new feeding options. &nbsp;One of which just came out of the oven.<br /><br />Mix 2lbs of ground beef with two eggs, and whatever seasoning you like. &nbsp;Spread it into a baking pan. &nbsp;Cook at 450 for ten minutes. &nbsp;Cover with sauce, cheese, pepperoni, whatever the fuck else you want (no potatoes I guess), broil it for like, 2 minutes.<br /><br />Meatza.<br /><br />I'll call it a tentative success. &nbsp;Which is good, because I was making it tonight as practice for the Football Festival this weekend.
