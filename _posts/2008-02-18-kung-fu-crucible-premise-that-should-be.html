The <a href="http://www.sjgames.com/pyramid/sample.html?id=2848">Kung Fu Crucible</a> is my role-playing white whale.  Written by <a href="http://chadu.livejournal.com/">Chad Underkoffler</a> and published in <a href="http://www.sjgames.com/pyramid/">Pyramid Magazine</a> in 2002, where I read it first with interest, then with growing astonishment.  I once purchased an entire year's subscription just to be able to find it again in the archives and save it to my hard drive.  I eventually burned it to a dvd with a bunch of other fiction game material, but that dvd was damaged and discarded.  So now I may need another 20$ for another year's subscription to Pyramid.<br /><br />Kung Fu Crucible is part of Mr. Underkoffler's Campaign in a Box series.  Each article presents a premise for a role-playing game, usually restricted in spatial scope; rather than gallivanting about the world, something is keeping the heroes in a particular location.  In this particular article, the premise us essentially identical to that of the classic TV show, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prisoner">The Prisoner</a>: For unknown reasons, people are being kept in a small village, isolated from the world, forced to forget their names and organize socially along rigidly defined forms. The heroes of the game would broadly follow the form of Number Six, the hero of the show, testing the limits of their captivity, defying their mysterious captor's efforts, or cooperating with them, or not being sure which is which.<br /><blockquote>Number Six: Where am I?<br />Number Two: In the Village.<br />#6: What do you want?<br />#2: Information.<br />#6: Whose side are you on?<br />#2: That would be telling. We want information. Information! INFORMATION!<br />#6: You won't get it.<br />#2: By hook or by crook, we will.<br />#6: Who are you?<br />#2: The new Number Two.<br />#6: Who is Number One?<br />#2: <i>(ignoring him)</i> You are Number Six.<br />#6: I am not a number â€” I am a free man!<br />#2:<i> (Laughter)</i><br /><div style="text-align: right;">Dialog heard in opening sequence of <span style="font-style: italic;">The Prisoner</span><br /></div></blockquote><br />The difference is that, rather than the characters being secret agents, and the village being a place entirely of surface and secrets, they are powerful kung-fu warriors, and it is also a place of near-constant training and battle.<br /><br />I love Kung Fu fiction, and I love bizarre secretive fiction.  Further, it seemed to me that these were two great tastes that go great together.<br /><br />Kung fu warriors, driven to push their bodies beyond all sane limits, despite whatever else might be said of them, are extremely self-possessed, self-defined, and self-centered.  It's a philosophical necessity: I need this power, because it would be good for me to have it, because my moral judgments are correct and when enforced, would improve the world.  The Village exists to challenge that sense of self.  In the show, the hero is constantly being tested and experimented on, and while the ultimate purpose is a mystery, the immediate questions are those of identity: what are you and why?<br /><br />Spies have been, through the course of their training and work, stripped of many comfortable illusions - about politics, about society, about human nature - and thus given a great power over and outside normal people.  They're different from normal people, but they see it the the other way around: Number six thinks of normal people as unquestioning sheep, already "prisoners" in their own villages of the mind, while his own mistrust and cynical insight makes him truly human, and truly free.  Kung Fu is an externalization of that inhumanity/humanity: Those who practice it are either beyond any human judge and standard, or human to the highest degree, mastering themselves and their environment, inflicting their irresistible will on all things.<br /><br />Spies exist to control the flow of information, so they would be gathered and hidden away in order to control that ability, in order to limit the number of people who are able to freely filter and interpret their own information.  It's obvious why, but it's equally obvious why Xia (by which, read "Kung Fu Warriors") would be gathered and hidden away too: To control the spread of abilities which let people make their own way in the world.<br /><br />The world changes when Kung Fu is added to it.  Hobbes based his system of politics on human nature, both mental and physical; There's no man so strong that he couldn't be killed in his sleep, so we're all in more or less equal danger from one another, so we'd all equally benefit from establishing societies where violence is stemmed in some way.  But when Kung Fu is possible, then we can say that, to quote <span style="font-style: italic;">Tenjho Tenge</span> (and lets do, because it's one of the great manga of our age), "in this world, there are unreasonably strong people."   Those people are uncontrolled, unrestrained by the laws and fears which guide the rest of us.  Clearly, something has arisen to provide those laws and fears.  The Village is necessarily terrifying, if not to the heroes, then at least to some of the other Xia stuck with them, and certainly to us mere folk vicariously parsing their fiction.<br /><br />So I hope you can understand why this premise seemed so awesome to me, and why I have always wanted to run a game that used it.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;font-size:130%;" >Statement of the Problem</span><br /><br />What would that game be?  How should it best be composed in order to support what is cool about the premise?<br /><br />The original article was written "rules agnostic," describing the premise in natural language ("tall and bare mountains," "powerful techniques") rather than in terms of a particular rules-system ("mountains that are difficulty 4 to climb," "techniques that give a +6 to attack and damage rolls").  The idea was that you could "port" the premise to any system you liked or, to say it more honestly, so you could tell the group that you always played with that it was a game in the same system that you always played together.<br /><br />(Of course, Mr. Underkoffler has also written the <a href="http://www.atomicsockmonkey.com/freebies.asp#pdq">Prose Descriptive Quality system</a>, whose systems act on such words as "fair," "good," "poor," etc.  He has many times commented that all of his Campaigns in the Box are in practice PDQ-ready.  More on this in later posts.)<br /><br />The problem with rules-agnosticism is that it is rooted in the faulty presumptions of what I call the "old school" of roleplaying games.  To wit: Game systems are basically equally capable of portraying any fiction, and people just play the one they're most familiar with, since it's that familiarity and skill, especially on the part of the Moderator, that determines whether a game is fun.<br /><br />As Ron Edwards says in <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/_articles/system_does_matter.html">System Does Matter</a>, effectively the new school's Magna Carta, "I flatly, entirely disagree."<br /><br />I should make it clear that "old school" and "new school" are terms of my own inventing, coined in order to avoid all the controversy that rages across the internet around around language like "indie," and also in order to make the only distinction that I think is important: how directly the game models its fiction.<br /><br />Old school games attempt to simulate realistic interaction of the lowest common denominators of fiction: real objects.  For example, the characters always have a collection of statistics representing physical and mental potential, most often close variations on Strength, Dexterity, Toughness, and Intelligence.  They also have another set that represents their practice and knowledge, usually called "skills."  In general, the goal of old school games is to attach a convincing mechanical act, for example rolling a die and checking a chart, to every fictional act, for example tying your shoes.  Of the two largest problems with this, the first is theoretical: Godel's incompleteness theorem applies, and there's no complex system that can simulate every possible act.  The other is practical: players get tired of rolling dice all the time, and the skill of being a Moderator becomes knowing what to ignore from the system, or when to ignore it all.<br /><br />The system of new school games are frequently designed to model fictional acts directly, rather than physical acts directly and fictional ones incidentally.  For example, in <span style="font-style: italic;">Capes</span>, superpowers are rated at how much effect they can have on the story, rather than their output in joules, and in <span style="font-style: italic;">Bliss Stage</span>, supporting characters are defined mechanically by their emotional importance to the heroes, not by their bench-press and IQ.<br /><br />Certain new school games, like <span style="font-style: italic;">Burning Empires</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">Weapons of the Gods</span>, retain an appearance of the old school, with traditional attribute/skill divisions, but other explicit systems are inevitably in place to focus the play along certain fictional lines.  <span style="font-style: italic;">Burning Empires </span>characters also have intense passions and plans, and are forced to act in a context of tense planetary warfare.  <span style="font-style: italic;">Weapons of the Gods </span>characters have driving passions, and social connections to their families and clans, and destinies, and their power is limited by the height (or depth, in the case of villains) of their virtue.<br /><br />Games like this are what I call "big:" players are presented with an entire world (or, in the case of <span style="font-style: italic;">Burning Empires</span>, a system for making worlds) and a broad array of ways to interact with that world, such that the kinds of characters they can make and the kinds of stories those characters pursue are less limited than in the typical, "small," new school game.  As a perfect example of the focus of a small game, in <span style="font-style: italic;">The Shab Al-hiri Roach</span>, characters are either professors or assisstant professors at Pemberton University who are simultaneously struggling with tenure politics and trying to manage an insect problem (an ancient, mind-controlling insect problem).  Play progresses through a set list of chronological events, surrounding the school year of 1920-something. The play is restrictive, though also hilarious and worth playing again and again. A small games is a lot like a board game.  In <span style="font-style: italic;">Monopoly</span>, say, players are always real-estate developers in New York, unless you play Miami Monopoly or Star Wars Monopoly, and in the same way, you can move <span style="font-style: italic;">The Roach</span> to other locations, and as long as the basic mechanics (whether buying and developing property or gathering renown for the sake of a life of ease) remain the same, the game will as well.  By contrast, the scope of "big" games is explicitly much larger; you could play an untenured scholar in both <span style="font-style: italic;">Burning Empires</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Weapons of the Gods</span>, as well as any number of other character concepts, but they are always going to be either trying to save their far-future world from alien invasion, or attaining their great personal goals at the end of much hard kung-fu-ing, respectively.<br /><br />Whether big or small, new school games are all designed with a self-awareness that the old school lacks.  Designers of the new school presume that, while there is no system that can model all fiction equally, <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">systems can be designed to model a given kind of fiction</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">.</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">The Mountain Witch</span> is about a rag-tag group of heroes caught between being unable to trust one another, and needing to.  Thus, every character has a dark secret that comes out in play, a trust rating hangs between each pair of characters and there is a betrayal mechanic which exploits that trust.  <span style="font-style: italic;">Capes </span>is about the joy of having superpowers, and the increased expectations on characters who have them.  Thus, characters can always use their super powers, but doing so accumulates a kind of story-debt that weighs them down, until they get rid of it by winning conflicts that prove their justice or nobility.  <span style="font-style: italic;">Weapons of the Gods</span> is about Wuxia heroes, traveling the countryside and cultivating their mastery to the greatest degree.  Thus, the character's power is limited their power is linked to the height (or depths) of their virtue.<br /><br />The analogy for me is the history of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_acting">method acting</a>.  It was invented in the 30s, long after much acting had already been done, and was seen as something new and shocking.  But now, it's just what we would call "acting."  It was a more successful model, and it completely supplanted the old one.  As far as I'm concerned, the new school of role-playing is just as superior to the old one.<br /><br />So, again, what would a game that sets out to bring the Crucible into the new school look like?<br /><br />-Nick
