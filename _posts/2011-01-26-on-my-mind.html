So far I'm setting no land speed records. &nbsp;It took me a week to leave Virginia, and now it's looking like two weeks to leave Georgia. &nbsp;Or is that two and three? &nbsp;The luxury of having no deadlines: dates fade into unimportance, and you seek daily and seasonal&nbsp;rhythms. &nbsp;The Modern Nomad. &nbsp;The Lazy Savage.<br /><br />My father's finally given me something of a deadline, though. &nbsp;The closing on his new houseboat will be some time in March, and since he will almost certainly be in Sausalito around then, so should I, because I love him and love that he's getting a houseboat.<br /><br />Right now I'm staying with Hiro, a friend from college. &nbsp;He has convinced me to teach him and a couple of our common friends to play one of my hippy fiction games, <a href="http://glyphpress.com/shock/">shock: social science fiction</a>. &nbsp;Can't wait to see what awesome ideas they/we come up with. &nbsp;That'll be this Saturday, and then I'll be travelling again as soon as Monday.<br /><br />At six hours of driving a day, that'll be about a week's travel. &nbsp;Though I might like to stay an extra day here or there.<br /><br />My old bank's card expires in February, and they have no branches in California anyway, so I'll probably close my account before leaving Atlanta, and travel on my stomach, so to speak. &nbsp;My new bank &nbsp;failed to send me my card before I started traveling, and won't send it to a PO Box, and I really should have called them weeks ago to send it here, like I planned...but as it happens, I may not get it for a while yet.<br /><br />At a bar recently, I mentioned to our server I was only passing through town. &nbsp;"Oh!" she said. &nbsp;"I can see the gears turning," I joked, "you're thinking 'So is he a serial killer, or...?'" &nbsp;"Well, as long as you don't pay in cash," she laughed. &nbsp;And then I did,&nbsp;of course, and it looks like I will be paying for everything in cash for a while yet. &nbsp;I knew it was a good idea to keep my security belt!<br /><br />It's hard enough to find single-month rentals when you're actually in the city where they're located. &nbsp;I can't wait to start calling people in San Francisco today and say things like "Hello, I'd like to send you a check to hold a room open for me sight unseen for just the month of February. &nbsp;I'm currently crossing the country Clampett-style and...hello? &nbsp;Did you just drive into a tunnel?"<br /><br /><b>update</b>: Half at Hiro's insistence, half of my own choosing, it's looking like I'll wait here for the card to be sent to me via my father. &nbsp;So another two weeks in Atlanta, perhaps.
