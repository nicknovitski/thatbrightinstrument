The area was dusted with snow yesterday, but compared to the levels we're used to, today qualifies as "buried."&nbsp; The train was slow, and the bus was slower, and I ended up traveling from 6:30 to 8:30, but other people were much later, so it wasn't a great concern.&nbsp; All of the people who were scheduled to talk to us eventually arrived, and we accomplished most of the agenda.&nbsp; Three idiosyncratic executives spoke with us, and individually encouraged us to arrange meetings with them if we had other questions, and individually said they really meant it, unlike the executives that say similar things at other big companies.<br /><br />Oh yeah.&nbsp; This company is huge.&nbsp; There are over 3000 employees working out of their location in Reston.&nbsp; There are six or seven more locations of the same size in the US, plus dozens of smaller ones, to say nothing of the world wide operations.&nbsp; All in all, over 180,000 employees.&nbsp; If this isn't the big leagues, what is? <br /><br />Yes, I am excited.<br /><br />Anyway, there was a lot of HR talk.&nbsp; This was the first day of three planned days of orientation, and we are expected to be continuing to learn .&nbsp; Some companies have an internal website, but we have an internal freaking internet.&nbsp; A site for health benefits!&nbsp; A site for your 401(k) and stock purchase plan!&nbsp; A site for planning meetings, for taking remote training, for submitting expense reports and on and on and on.<br /><br />I've been restraining myself from mentioning the company's name in this post, for the same reason that I'd restrain myself from mentioning friends by name: I'm not sure if they'd prefer to be mentioned.&nbsp; However, unlike a friend, my association with the company is a matter of public record, and I have signed explicit contracts discussing the sorts of information that I can and can't share publicly...But still, it just seems gauche.<br /><br />We were eventually let free an hour early, to beat the traffic.&nbsp; This did not help me at all: including waiting for the bus, it was still a two-hour trek back.&nbsp; And tomorrow, I do it all over again!<br /><br />However, Daniel's been kind enough to let me borrow his pair of gloves that fit me, and I've revised my planned wardrobe back to "business casual" from "business classic."&nbsp; Both of these changes will make tomorrow's travel slightly less bracing than today's.&nbsp; And even if not, the job seems to be worth a little snow.<br /><br />-Nick
