<b>Don't ask people what they do for a living</b>. &nbsp;Who gives a shit? &nbsp;What insight will that give you? &nbsp;What are the odds that what they do all day is something they really want to talk about?<br /><br />It's only helpful to know if they have a particularly low or high status job, so you can know if you should be imperious or obsequious to them. &nbsp;So basically, only if you are a spineless/arrogant noodnik. <br /><br />Instead, <b>ask them what they do for fun</b>. &nbsp;They'll like talking about it, it'll tell you something significant about them, you can learn about something interesting. &nbsp;And if they have no real answer, you'll know that they're boring and can safely leave them alone.<br /><br />On the off chance that they do love some activity that they also earn money from, they may mention it.
