I just realized that I didn't explain in <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2008-02-29-issue-zero-mechanics %}">the previous post</a> why I called one of the difficulties in translating <span style="font-style: italic;">Breaking the Ice</span> into <span style="font-style: italic;">Issue Zero</span> the "drunken hobo issue."<br /><br />As I heard it, Stephen Jay Gould invented the drunken hobo as an example of a certain kind of system.  In his case, he was trying to explain why the evolution of intelligence wasn't as unlikely as it seemed.<br /><br />Imagine a drunken hobo walking down the sidewalk.  For every step he takes forward, his inebriation and loss of balance simultaneously takes him one step either to the left or right.  Let's say he's walking on the right side of the street; to his right is the wall of buildings, and to his left is the gutter.  If he's walked far enough to the right such that he's hitting the wall, he can't go any further right, just either forward or forward-and-left.  On the other hand, if he walks far enough to the left, he falls in the gutter, hits his head, and sleeps until he is found by street cleaners the next morning.<br /><br />The point of this is, no matter how unlikely it is that the hobo step to the left, even if it's only a 1% chance opposed to a 99% chance that he'll step right, such a system always ends exactly the same way, with the hobo in the gutter.<br /><br />In Gould's case, he was arguing that intelligence was such a system: brain mass (or whatever other biological factors self-awareness and abstract thought depends on) can only <span style="font-style: italic;">decrease</span> so much, so no matter how unlikely its <span style="font-style: italic;">increase</span> is, passing the level needed for true intelligence is just a matter of time.<br /><br />In my case, I just meant to suggest that Issue Zero should<span style="font-style: italic;"></span> be a drunken hobo system, but that Breaking the Ice isn't.  I have to change a game with an uncertain outcome into a system with a given outcome.  So rather than playing three dates and tallying up attraction levels and compatibilities to see how well they did, I might just require a certain number of each, and end the game whenever those numbers are reached.<br /><br />I'm glad we had this talk.<br /><br />-Nick
