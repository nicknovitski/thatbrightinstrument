Hey look, photoblogging! &nbsp;That's what comes of getting a new phone. &nbsp;No doubt it's a passing fad; nothing important can come of giving the internet millions of roving eyeballs, right? &nbsp;Well, you know what they say: with sufficient eyeballs, all advertising is shallow. &nbsp;Guess what I saw yesterday! &nbsp;If you reflexively said "it's not lupus," then you're <span class="Apple-style-span" style="text-decoration: underline;">absolutely wrong</span>&nbsp;(and watching too many medical procedurals) !<br /><br />Let's play "spot the offensive difference."<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_4s_kbVFrc84/SruwY4nuJOI/AAAAAAAADPE/bDpKJfh5q7w/s1600-h/2009-09-23+17.56.01.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_4s_kbVFrc84/SruwY4nuJOI/AAAAAAAADPE/bDpKJfh5q7w/s320/2009-09-23+17.56.01.jpg" /></a><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">"One day, she'll win a seat in Congress. &nbsp;Right now, she's winning her battle with lupus."<br /></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_4s_kbVFrc84/SruxYcedKCI/AAAAAAAADPM/G16mmnpnqy0/s1600-h/2009-09-23+17.56.18.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_4s_kbVFrc84/SruxYcedKCI/AAAAAAAADPM/G16mmnpnqy0/s320/2009-09-23+17.56.18.jpg" /></a><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">"One day, he'll fight for his country. &nbsp;Right now, he's fighting lupus."<br /></div><br />This shit gave me a double take. &nbsp;Actually, there was also a third ad, which I failed to get a picture of, as I was too busy exclaiming "Oh, come ON!", depicting a female black person, who will apparently someday "teach our children," but right now she's teaching lupus or something. <br /><br />Such lovely, subservient roles we've accorded to them! &nbsp;It's a feel good story for everyone. <br /><br />-Nick
