For nearly half my life, I've wondered what song is being sung in the intro movie to the original <i>Quake</i> mod <i>Team Fortress</i>.  Specifically, I've wondered since said movie was released as part of version 2.0 of said mod, released 22 December 1996. <br /><br /><object height="344" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/8FVJ__rBFxk&hl=en&fs=1&"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/8FVJ__rBFxk&hl=en&fs=1&" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object><br /><br />I always found it delightfully punchy and suggestive, liable to spark the imagination.  It's stuck with me, even over a decade after I had last played the game.  And many times over the years, I've tried to find out just what the hell it is. &nbsp;I've pored over the manuals and readmes, scoured the internet, sent emails to the developers, even hummed it to music buffs. &nbsp;Failure! &nbsp;Ignominy!<br /><br />Now, thanks to a commenter in the above youtube video, THE SEARCH HAS ENDED. &nbsp; I humbly present: from Carl Orff's Carmina Burana, <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/EcceGratum">Ecce Gratum</a>.<br /><br />The lyrics are all about spring and the growing of green things. &nbsp;The repetition of the theme is suggestive in it's own way. &nbsp;It makes me think of the triple-repetitions of fairy tales, or maybe a generational cycle of blood-streaked revenge amongst the pealing peaks of goat-specked mountains.<br /><br />This is no doubt not Mr. Orff's fault!<br /><br />-Nick
