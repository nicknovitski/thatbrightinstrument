So over on the TIGSource forums, there's this announcement of free-form, prizeless, pointless <a href="http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=1214.0">Video Game Name Generator Competition</a>.  To wit:<br /><ol><li>Go to the <a href="http://www.norefuge.net/vgng/vgng.html">Video Game Name Generator</a>.</li><li>Generate a name that just sounds right.</li><li>MAKE THAT GAME.<br /></li></ol>I was just perusing the thread and clicking on the name generator in amusement, until I was granted a miracle.<br /><br /><span style="color: #cc0000; font-size: 180%;">DWARVEN MOON SOLDIER</span><br /><br />With graduation nigh, I've been wanting to make an interactive writing sample that doesn't require the user to have Neverwinter Nights to play, the way that <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2008-01-16-in-grove %}">In a Grove</a> does.  Specifically, I think that <a href="http://inform-fiction.org/I7/Welcome.html">Inform 7</a> would let me develop both logic and prose skills, prototype rapidly, publish to every platform simultaneously, etc.  All that was lacking was an idea, which I think I now have the roots of.<br /><br />What does this title tell us?  "Soldier" means there's some kind of war or conflict, either raging or incipient.  It also means that the rest of the title refers to the character that the player controls, since there has never been a game with "soldier" in the title where this was not the case.  That means that it is he that is "dwarven," and not his enemies or allies.  Distinctly dwarven activities include DIGGING and FORGING.  Perhaps exploring the mineral deposits on a "moon?"<br /><br />Metroid meets Dwarf Fortress via Interactive Fiction: You explore an alien world alone, tunneling through different areas and extending your capacities by expanding your home and holdings with devices or rooms you yourself build.<br /><br />Undoubtedly, there was a disaster during landing. Disastrous crash landings into lonely areas are one of the great cliches of Interactive Fiction, but there's a reason for that: You don't have to model more than a handful of NPCs or interesting objects, you can scatter them around the planet, and you can immediately give the player a motive for exploring and collecting things.<br /><br />I'm amazed at how many ideas got kicked off by a silly name generating page.  There's a lesson here about creativity flowing from the no-mans-land between the blank page and the completed novel, but I'm too busy with vacationing to write about it now.<br /><br />-Nick
