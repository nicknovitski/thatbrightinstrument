This is what <a href="http://www.story-games.com/">story-games</a> might call a "little idea"; a system that is more of a sub-system, which can partially inform a game, or be bolted on to one.  Since I'm doing the latter, I want to make it system-agnostic, which is to say, such that it doesn't refer to features of the parent game it is bolted to which not all games have; it should work with every game.<br /><br />Yet, that's not precisely possible.  Let's look at some exceptions, before identifying our target group, and the proposed goals of this project.<br /><br />First, some games either provide an explicit context for the character's adventuring together, or obviate it altogether by requiring them to <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> adventure together.  For example, in <span style="font-style: italic;">AGON</span>, the player characters are literally in the same boat, sent from island to island by the whim of the gods.  Since they have a history already (the Trojan War), are now stuck with one another and are given goals as a group, there's no question of how they came to be together, or why they continue to be together.  From the opposite end of this spectrum, in <span style="font-style: italic;">The Shab al-Hiri Roach</span>, the player characters are all faculty at Pemberton College, scheming to win tenure for themselves.  There's no question why they're stuck with each other, but since they are working at cross-purposes, constantly undercutting one another, there's no need to give a reason for them to work together, since they conspicuously don't: That's the point of the game.<br /><br />Second, some games use systems which permit or force asynchronous or partially-synchronous play.  This sounds fancier than it really is.  I just mean that, for some games, "splitting up the party" isn't the trouble and strife which it is in <span style="font-style: italic;">Dungeons and Dragons</span> and all other games suspiciously similar to it.  For example, since a given turn of <span style="font-style: italic;">WUSHU</span> can represent any length of in-fiction time, and the goals and challenges are defined in terms of fiction rather than reality, the characters can be working together no matter how far away they are.  In a given turn, one player might narrate how he disables the Death Star's tractor beam, while two others describe breaking into the detention level to rescue the fourth, who herself is describing the things she did in an earlier, failed escape attempt, and how those things are assisting the others.  Wushu is an extreme example, but many people seem to play the slightly-more-fixed-in-space-and-time <span style="font-style: italic;">Sorceror</span> in this way as well: The system runs smoothly and swiftly enough that letting one person do a few things by themselves is no great burden, as long as it comes back to you eventually.  Other games explicitly apportion this time in the spotlight: in <span style="font-style: italic;">Don't Rest Your Head</span>, only one character <span style="font-style: italic;">acts</span> in each scene, though more than one might be present.  There is no pressing need, in any of these games, for the characters to remain in a single group, and in all but <span style="font-style: italic;">WUSHU</span>, there's no need for them even to have non-conflicting goals.<br /><br />So, what we're looking for is a game whose system in practice requires that the heroes stay close to one another, but whose fiction does not provide a reason for that togetherness.  In the absence of this latter, the Issue Zero system will provide a method for determining a premise for group adventure, a reason for the characters cohering into that classic standard unit, the "party."<br /><br />As inspiration, let's look at every buddy movie ever made.  Here we have two people who may not have much in common (in fact, the less they like one another, the more entertaining it is!), and who may have never met, but for some event which compels them together.  After they have been introduced to the audience, the story begins with something happening such that...<br /><ul><li>They <span style="font-weight: bold;">must</span> stick together.</li></ul>This may be because one of them is under orders to stick with the other (<span style="font-style: italic;">Rush Hour</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Lethal Weapon</span>), or because one sees a utility in the other (<span style="font-style: italic;">Midnight Run</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">48 Hours</span>), or just because of circumstances (<span style="font-style: italic;">Every Movie Where Two Guys are Chained Together or are Mistaken for Friends, to Their Detriment</span>).  It's possible that they each have their reasons for sticking with the other, or even both of them want out of the arrangement, but for some amount of time, whether as brief as a stopover in JFK or as long as a quest for the lost treasure of the Aztecs, stuck they remain.<br /><br />But for adventuring, this is insufficient.  However compelling the reason that you have to hang together, the more time passes, the more likely that the characters will find ways to hang separately.  Maybe one will decide the dingus we're all questing for isn't worth the risk, or maybe he'll find something else he wants more, or maybe he'll just escape the captivity or responsibility that bound him.  Whatever the case, it will either happen, or the GM or group will noticeably hand-wave it away.  LAME.<br /><br />Thus, as you see in every buddy movie, something else will develop.  Though the original reason for the two's juxtaposition has fallen away, there stands revealed a deeper bond.  Friendship, respect, love, admiration...whatever you want to call it, despite their differences...<br /><ul><li>They <span style="font-weight: bold;">want</span> to stick together.<br /></li></ul>There's something that each has come to see and appreciate in the other.  It's even possible that the original reason hasn't been resolved yet, but the important thing is, even if it was, the two heroes would remain friends.  Of course, though the buddy movie example is a case of two people, a game might (and probably will) feature more than two protagonists, and obviously, the more people in the party, the more necessary an explicit reason that each stays with all the others.<br /><br />So that's what Issue Zero should do:  For each pair of characters, tell a story that starts with "how we met and why it didn't end there," and ends with "how we came to realize that we were meant to continue on together."<br /><br />As to how, it's occurred to me that the buddy-cop premise mirrors very closely the romantic-comedy premise, and there already is a romantic-comedy fiction game, <span style="font-style: italic;">Breaking the Ice</span>.  If I wanted to try to use <span style="font-style: italic;">BtI</span> in this way, I would need to modify it such that I fixed the terminology issue and the drunken hobo issue.<br /><br />The terminology issue is simply that certain aspects of the game's system are named assuming the specifically romantic involvement of the two principals.  They go out on a series of "Dates," are awarded "Attraction Levels" for successful rolls.  Now, I'm perfectly happy to admit that the buddies in buddy films do grow to love each other, but "love" is a loaded and ambiguous term in modern english, so I'd much rather strip it out and replace it with a concept more immediately approachable.  Demographics suggest that, at least in my own games, men will be playing Issue Zero with other men, and I am willing to take steps to assist their imaginations and assuage their discomfort.  In any case, renaming "attraction" "affection" should be alright, though "date" gives me a bigger problem.  It's clear, watching buddy films, when the characters are out on a "date" in <span style="font-style: italic;">BtI</span> terms, but I'm not sure what to call them.  I want the term to be suggestively neutral, if that makes any sense.  For now, I guess I'll just call them "events."<br /><br />The drunken hobo issue is the difference between the full game that <span style="font-style: italic;">BtI</span> is, with player efforts towards a positive resolution, and the pre-game that Issue Zero would be, where the ending is already written: the group has already made their band of heroes, and we're presuming that they do admire one another and adventure together.  Taking a first stab at altering the game to fit that presumption, I'll try...<br /><ol><li>Removing the patented favorite color character generation engine.  The players will have already made their characters in the system of the "actual" game, so they'll just use those character sheets and concepts as inspiration for the traits of the BtI character.</li><li>Only running two "dates."  The third date is the adventure!<br /></li></ol>I'm going to try having two people actually play this on Sunday.  As they say in <span style="font-style: italic;">Polaris</span>, we shall see what comes of it.<br /><br />-Nick
