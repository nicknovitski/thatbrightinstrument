<div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">Part 1 was my form of gushing, and it was right to start this series with giving the immediate context: for a large number of people, including myself, Blizzard is awesome.<br /><br />But problems deserve to be the first thing addressed. &nbsp;I wouldn't feel right putting this segment (and the next one, Race) at the end of the sequence, as if they were appendices. &nbsp;These sorts of thoughts are central to my perceptions of Blizzard properties, whether they like it or not.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">So, it was revealed a year or so ago that <i>Diablo 3</i>, for the first time in the series, would let you choose between male and female avatars for each class. &nbsp;This was striking.<br /><br />Before this announcement, when the (male) <a href="http://www.blizzard.com/diablo3/characters/barbarian.xml">Barbarian class</a> was unveiled, I gave a whoop of joy. &nbsp;He's <span style="text-decoration: underline;">old</span>. &nbsp;This is&nbsp;<i>Phoenix on the Sword</i> Conan meets&nbsp;<i>The Light Fantastic&nbsp;</i>Cohen. &nbsp;He may very well be the same Barbarian of <i>Diablo 2</i>, thirty or forty years on, having failed to die so many times in such incredible circumstances that he's no longer sure if he knows how. &nbsp;He should be raising barns to house his children, but the call for heroes finds him on the side of a mountain, roasting a bear, and he does not even consider <i>not</i> facing the KINGS OF THE DEVILS yet again.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_4s_kbVFrc84/SpR_y0X3spI/AAAAAAAADMg/bqlCgnQOYV8/s1600-h/IMG_0210.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_4s_kbVFrc84/SpR_y0X3spI/AAAAAAAADMg/bqlCgnQOYV8/s320/IMG_0210.JPG" /></a></div><br /><br />Sweeeet...<br /><br />Then the female Barbarian was revealed, and I was even more overjoyed.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_4s_kbVFrc84/SpSB3ZHvDaI/AAAAAAAADMo/P8d2EL_eNqc/s1600-h/female-barbarian-hires.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_4s_kbVFrc84/SpSB3ZHvDaI/AAAAAAAADMo/P8d2EL_eNqc/s320/female-barbarian-hires.jpg" /></a></div><br /><br />It has been said that pop culture's portrayal of "bad-ass" girls ranges from full-bodied objectification to spritely paedophilia, and that they should look more like this female shot-put champion:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://berlin.iaaf.org/mm/photo/competitions/competition/04/67/52/46752_full-lnd.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="133" src="http://berlin.iaaf.org/mm/photo/competitions/competition/04/67/52/46752_full-lnd.jpg" width="200" /></a></div><br />And the female Barbarian is that. &nbsp;She's not perfect: a slight she-hulk vibe persists, with the big hair and the dominatrix sexuality and everything. &nbsp;But she's built and dressed as unapologetically as her male counterpart, &nbsp;to crush her enemies, see them driven before her, and...well, the point is, she's an Awesome Woman Kicking Ass, just like <a href="http://kynn.com/games/awesome-women-kicking-ass-1.0.pdf">the game</a>!<br /><br />I still mean to play that one...</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br />And yes, let's switch games for a moment.<br /><br />The tall and lissome Tricia Helfer was announced as the voice talent portraying Kerrigan in <i>Starcraft 2</i>. &nbsp;This was revealed with mild fanfare, and a milder reaction. <br /><br />Helfer was&nbsp;catapulted to the heights nerd-recognizability for portraying the the character of Number 6 on Battlestar Galactica, a crazed sexpot hallucination, a psychotic inhuman thing that takes over your life, won't stop talking about children and being together <i>forever</i>, which you're always either fucking or running from in terror. <br /><br />So no, not the most progressive of roles. &nbsp;Is Kerrigan an improvement?<br /><br />Maybe.<br /><br />See, there were three female characters in <i>Starcraft</i>: the unnamed dropship pilots (you know, like in&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Aliens</span>no other intellectual property I know of), the unnamed Valkyrie (get it?!) fighter-jet pilots, and Sarah Kerrigan, special ops badass, abandoned by her allies to the evil aliens, shaped into a weapon of fear and horror, who betrayed and consumed her own hive-mind and became the post-human leader of a non-human army.<br /><br />(Amusingly, this later became the exact same story of Arthas the Lich King, current big bad of <i>World of Warcraft</i>. &nbsp;Behind every male boss-monster...)</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><br />Oh, and before someone bothers to correct me, the game's expansion, <i>Brood War</i>, added a third female: the Medic, also unnamed, who had no weapon, but just followed the testosterone-dripping marines around at a respectful distance, supporting and tending to them. &nbsp;Yeah, I know.<br /><br />Anyway,<i> Brood War</i>&nbsp;ends with Kerrigan's apotheosis, which comes after a rejection of the one person (okay, it's a man) who might have convinced her to not try to consume the universe. &nbsp;Paraphrasing, her parting shot is "Gentlemen, prepare to be fucked." &nbsp;She's another smothering, all-encompassing trans-female villain, in the vein of <i>System Shock</i>'s&nbsp;SHODAN. <br /><br />They've made her a life-size statue, which was at the convention, complete with glowing eyes, wing-like scythe claws, and shapely ass. &nbsp;I refused to take a picture of it, because I don't masturbate to&nbsp;<a href="http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&amp;source=hp&amp;q=guyver&amp;gbv=2&amp;aq=f&amp;oq=&amp;aqi=g10">The Guyver</a>&nbsp;with a reptile-skin glove, and but I did take this picture of a piece in the art gallery which, I think, depicts her in a later stage of "evolution" (boy do sci-fi games love to misuse that word).</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"></div><div></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_4s_kbVFrc84/SpSIhgb1GfI/AAAAAAAADMw/4Y19J8tp0Rg/s1600-h/IMG_0200.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_4s_kbVFrc84/SpSIhgb1GfI/AAAAAAAADMw/4Y19J8tp0Rg/s320/IMG_0200.JPG" /></a></div><br /><br />What an awesome picture! &nbsp;She is unlike any other alien form, and is holding a skull and...contemplating? &nbsp;Did she know him, Horatio? &nbsp;Does she remember Kerrigan? &nbsp;Does she ever regret her irreversible path of vengeance? &nbsp;Forget the pre-civilized Barbarian. &nbsp;This Kerrigan is post-civilized, post-biological...post-everything! &nbsp;An egotist so driven and single-minded that the universe may break before she does. &nbsp;She's Foyle from&nbsp;<i>The Stars My Destination </i>meets Dave from <i>2001</i>.<br /><br />But this is my wishful thinking. &nbsp;I don't really know if that's Kerrigan, or some other unannounced character. &nbsp;In statue form, in all the cutscenes and promotional pictures, she is slim and athletic, yet quite feminine. &nbsp;Why? &nbsp;Because at least 80% of Blizzard's customers are male, and the other 20% are their wives and girlfriends. &nbsp;Because one of the eight principles is "Embrace your inner geek," and in genderless English, "geek" is a clearly masculine word.<br /><br />-Nick
