Last summer I visited Ireland with Hiro.  I had a great time.  We took pictures, though not enough.  I made a Picasa Web Album with them.<br /><table style="width: 194px;"><tbody><tr><td align="center" style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: transparent url(http://picasaweb.google.com/f/img/transparent_album_background.gif) no-repeat scroll left center; height: 194px;"><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/nicknovitski/Summer2006Ireland"><img height="160" src="http://lh5.google.com/image/nicknovitski/Rhfv40tX71E/AAAAAAAAAfI/IR2-5OKd94g/s160-c/Summer2006Ireland.jpg" style="margin: 1px 0pt 0pt 4px;" width="160" /></a></td></tr><tr><td style="font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 11px; text-align: center;"><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/nicknovitski/Summer2006Ireland" style="color: #4d4d4d; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;">Summer 2006 Ireland</a></td></tr></tbody></table>I'm labeling this post "writing," because one of the two reasons I'm publishing the album a year late is that I put a fair amount of effort into arranging and captioning it.  I hope people are able to enjoy my see-sawing mood!<br /><br />The other reason is that it was Hiro's camera, and he didn't send me the pictures until not so long ago.  Which is okay, since he goes to a real school, which takes a lot of his time.
