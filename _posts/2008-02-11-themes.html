Role-playing games, at least as I have experienced them, are missing music.<br /><br />I think that music is one of my great emotional fracture-points.  Books can't make me cry, but movies can.  To be specific, while compelling and sad stories can make me sad, regardless of their medium, they essentially never make me cry.  Only tragic things <span style="font-style: italic;">which are also real</span> have a chance at affecting me in that way.  But when movies instead seek to stir me, to present me not with something tragic, but something immense, with people of super-human passions and characters committing themselves to greatness regardless of the potential or unavoidable cost to their bodies and lives, as well as music that fits the action, then I <span style="font-style: italic;"></span>happily and regularly cry.<br /><br />All of which is, to vastly over-generalize, exactly what should be happening in a serious roleplaying session.<br /><br />The best example I can think of at the moment (mostly since I watched it twice today) is the scene in Kung Fu Hustle that ends with Coolie catching the lighter.  Kung Fu Hustle has some of the best music I've seen in a movie, and the scene in question lets almost all sound effects fall into silence as the trilling of zithers builds upon a simple cascading theme into a swelling heroic anthem.  Your eyes are telling you something terrible is going to happen, and your ears are telling you that the hero enters only when things seem to have reached their worst.  It's a tension that gets me tearing up with joy every time.  Every.  Time.<br /><br />When role-playing games were (or are) variations on the tactical war-game, music would distract players from the explicit purpose of planning moves for maximizing your side's advantage.  But now that we have games whose explicit purpose is emotionally focused, or at least mood-centric, music's absence is no longer required.  In fact, its presence is demanded, at least by me.<br /><br />I've thought this before, and tried to do something about it.  I assembled playlists from what music I had and could get, and brought them to gaming sessions, either as CDs or on a digital media player.  It was unsatisfying.  The music wasn't played often enough, and wasn't matched to the mood enough.  It didn't ever have remotely the same effect that it's had in the movies whose magic I was hoping to bottle.<br /><br />When I don't feel able to successfully deliver on the promise of a game-playing technology, I either drop it, or I try to figure out a way to convince players to do it for me.  So that's what I'm up to here.<br /><br />The idea is, the group collaborates to put together a soundtrack.<br /><br />As part of character creation, every player selects a theme: Any song that they think should play when their character is either doing the thing she's best at or expressing her innermost feelings.  Important not-player-controlled characters who should be recurring regularly (player rivals, loved-ones, the Boss Monster, etc.) get one too, selected by the Moderator.<br /><br />(Though, of course, it goes without saying that everyone at the table should be cool with every song being chosen)<br /><br />Then, you need the slightly more abstract and "thematic" Themes.  If you'll forgive me for borrowing terminology from video game development, you'll want to make a list of your game's planned "high-level verbs."  That is, as a group (chalkboards help), write all the kinds of action that the game should feature.  "High-level" just means that you focus on the verbs that are composed of lots of little verb-atoms: rather than initiative rolls or token allocation or combat phases, these are the kinds of scenes the heroes will become a part of.  For example, if you're playing an archetypal dungeon crawl, you might come up with something like this:<br /><ol><li>Venturing into dark and dangerous caves,</li><li>Fighting in pitched battles,<br /></li><li>Facing the Boss at the bottom of the dungeon,</li><li>Collecting immense treasure, and<br /></li><li>Shopping/Carousing to prepare for the next adventure.</li></ol>You should have at least one theme for each verb.  The first resource should be the suggestions of players, but if no one has a clear idea, trawl your hard drive and the internet until you find a song that fits.  In this post-Napster era, the best place to download songs that you've already heard is the <a href="http://thepiratebay.org/">Pirate Bay</a>.  I have no idea as to the best place to find new, unheard songs.  The only help I can give is all the bookmarks I've put the "sounds" tag on, from least presumed use to most.<br /><ul><li><a href="http://cylinders.library.ucsb.edu/index.php">Cylinder Preservation and Digitization Project</a></li><li><a href="http://www.magnatune.com/">Magnatune</a> (not free)</li><li><a href="http://www.mikseri.net/users/?id=61143">Michikawa</a></li><li><a href="http://www.ocremix.org/">OverClocked ReMix</a></li><li><a href="http://www.vgmix.com/">VGMix</a></li><li><a href="http://www.last.fm/">Last.fm</a><br /></li></ul>Now that we have a track list, the goal is to have those tracks be played at the appropriate times.  As I've said, I want to convince players to remember it for me, and the one of the best ways to get players to do something optional is to <span style="font-style: italic;">attach concrete and immediate mechanical benefits to it</span>.<br /><br />In general, the themes are played when the players call for them, no more than once per session (have a little checklist handy), and give some kind of bonus for as long as they last.  This time limit will encourage the players to focus on whatever kind of action the theme supports, getting as much stuff done with as little side-chat or unrelated actions as possible.  As long as the theme is playing, the bonus will reward players for remaining...in theme!<br /><br />Specifically, the thematic themes should reward players who take part in their associated verbs, and the character themes should reward players who make that character look awesome.  That will usually be that character's player, but, as I've said, major non-player-controlled characters get them too.  In those cases, the players will still call for the theme to be played, and they'll still get a bonus, as long as they emote sufficient amazement, fear, or in general act impressed with the NPC.<br /><br />Of course, since the plan I've detailed so far is made to work with any system whatsoever, I have no way of detailing these benefits; The specific bonuses will depend on the system.  The tracks should benefit the players somehow, but the specific bonuses will depend entirely on the system.  But then again, I am planning on using this myself with Weapons of the Gods, so I might as well say what my plans are vis-a-vis that.<br /><br />Luckily, WotG already includes a system for gaining a bonus for acting in a certain way.  In general, they are called "Chi Conditions."  Basically, a learned doctor or sneaky courtier or powerful sage diagnoses or causes (in system terms, the two actions are identical) a character to either receive a bonus as long as he is described as acting a certain way, or a penalty as long as he isn't.  Conditions have three different levels of severity.  I'm going to have music be a kind of Minor Condition, the middle level.  These are the different benefits that Minor Chi Conditions can give to characters who follow them (with further context or thoughts in parentheses):<br /><ul><li>One of the Character's Attributes is increased by 2 for the scene.  (Attributes range from 1 to 5 for starting characters, and are storehouses of the Chi used for all kung-fu abilities.)<br /></li><li>The Character receives 1 Destiny whenever following the tenets of the condition gets him in trouble. (Destiny is the game's experience metric.  You could expect, in my game, to receive between four and ten per session.)<br /></li><li>The Character recovers 1 more of a given color of Chi each round (Normally, characters recover only 1 of each Chi per round, so this doubles that...not inconsiderable!)</li><li>The Character gets +5 on appropriate rolls, or adds +5 to his weapon's Strike.  (As a rule, bonuses don't stack, so players look for the best bonus they can get on a given roll, rather than wasting doing-fun-stuff time looking for <span style="font-style: italic;">every</span> bonus they can get.  Meaning that players who already have a bonus on rolls won't necessarily bother with the music.  but weapon statistics are an exception.  As you might think, Strike is the "chance to hit" modifier.)<br /></li></ul>Different characters will have kung fu that uses different colors of chi.  That means that a condition that I specify as having the first or third effect, and as giving it to a certain color, will be less useful for some players.  Thus, I think that, since thematic themes should be as inclusive as possible, the fourth option will be best: as long as the characters are participating in the associated verb of the track being played, they have an automatic +5 on all their rolls.  In game terms, they have <span style="font-weight: bold;">Quality Soundtrack +5</span>.<br /><br />As far as the themes of major NPCs, I'm going with the second option: Whenever the players narrate their characters being stymied by the efforts and awesomeness of their enemy/rival/"It's complicated," they get a destiny.<br /><br />Finally, for the player-controlled character themes, I think that allowing players to customize the effects of their conditions will be fine; it will only be affecting their character, after all.  However, when they may be played and what they may affect will be slightly more limited.<br /><br />Character development in WotG is handled on a divided system:  As I've said, you can gain Destiny from a variety of sources, which are spent to develop knowledge and connections to the setting.  But the only way to rise in Rank in the Martial Arts World, raising the limits on your Attributes and other impressive things, is by doing "Deeds."  Deeds are any action that is both impressive, entertaining the players around the table, and virtuous, in accordance with one of the five xia or five corrupt virtues.  These are Justice, Benevolence, Righteousness, Loyalty and Force, or Revenge, Individualism, Obsession, Ruthlessness and Ferocity.<br /><br />Whenever a player's character accomplishes a Deed, the player has the option to have their theme start playing (remember, you can only do it once per session!).  While it's still being heard, the music's benefit applies to anything their character does in accordance with the virtue of the deed that kicked things off.  In short, once per session, a Deed will mark the beginning of a miniature scene which focuses on your character's virtue.<br /><br />Which seems like it can actually closely approximate the feeling I get from Coolie's stand against the Axe Gang.  Which should be the standard that I test the results by, right?<br /><br />Now, the real problem is being able to rapidly find, among all the music on your computer, songs that fit a given mood and theme.  More on that later.<br /><br />-Nick
