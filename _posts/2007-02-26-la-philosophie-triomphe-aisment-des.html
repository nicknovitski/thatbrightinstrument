[Here's my last language paper.  It was pointed out to me recently that I (and the four other students who share every class with me) only had four essays assigned in the first semester, compared to the average of six.  Unfortunately, I would not venture to say that quality won out over quantity in my case.]<br /><br /><span style="font-family: lucida grande; font-style: italic;">La philosophie triomphe aisément des maux passés et des maux à venir.  Mais les maux présents triomphent d'elle. </span><span style="font-family: lucida grande;">[Philosophy easily defeats past ills and ills to come.  But present ills defeat Philosophy.]</span><br /><span style="font-family: lucida grande;">-Maxime 22, Rochefoucauld</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: lucida grande;">Near the end of Plutarch's life of Cato, with the Rome he fought for lost and his death approaching, the statesman finds solace in "Plato's dialogue on the soul."  In </span><span style="font-family: lucida grande; font-style: italic;">De Rerum Natura</span><span style="font-family: lucida grande;">, Lucretius finds solace in the Epicurean claims that fears of death and the supernatural come from misperceptions of how things truly are.  But whether stoic or sensualist, for all they might firm us against future tragedies or let us come to terms with past ones, all philosophies fail in the face of the tragedy itself, as it happens.  Perhaps there are no atheists in foxholes, but neither do even the most devout find comfort in foxhole prayer, in the extreme of pain and fear.  </span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: lucida grande;">And these philosophies which overcome our misfortunes certainly include prayers, or rather, religions, as well.  The sentiment is almost identical to Lucretius's anecdote about the priest of a particular temple of Poseidon showing a skeptical visitor about.  The priest indicates a wall covered with the inscriptions and buried beneath the donatives of sailors who had prayed to be saved in the midst of perilous storms and escaped unscathed.  Wasn't this a stirring demonstration of the power of both the god and his temple.  "Maybe," the visitor responds hesitantly, "but where are all the donations from the sailors who weren't saved?"  Misfortune leads us to cry out to the gods of our culture, but our prayers are defeated by the present ill.  Pain is more real than any god, and tragedy is never accounted for by any system of belief, except either before or after the fact.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: lucida grande;">I say "belief" only to include religious faith in the reduction, not to ignore that it is "philosophy" that is being reduced.  It is not that some gullible people are guided by untested faith in invisible saviors, while those who bother to examine themselves are Philosophers, entirely different creatures, safe in their icy castles of reason, immune to these delusions of comfort.  All</span><span style="font-family: lucida grande; font-weight: bold;"> </span><span style="font-family: lucida grande;">philosophies, including but not limited to super-naturalist faiths, are alike in that they can only comfort inasmuch as they can account for ills in a way that is comforting.  The actual action of philosophy is this accounting, while comfort is the result.  So if philosophy fails in the face of present ills, it fails to account for them.  But if any philosophy ever fails at all, it is in its action, in failing to account for something.  And if philosophy fails in action, that is certainly an ill, so to face the ills of the present moment is to fail by definition.  But it is not the ill that defeats philosophy, for those past and those yet to come are defeated.  No, it is that the hardship is present, that it is actually happening even now.  The present, the section of time most verifiably real, is antithetical to philosophy</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: lucida grande;">Only the past and future can be systematized into an understandable account.  The past, since it is narrated to us by memory and tastes.  Freed from the dross of the events which gave us the memory, dry and safe ideas can be sorted by our reason and beliefs, and unrestrained by the linearity of material causes, those ideas and their sortings change as quickly as our preference of how to remember it does.  The past is mutable, and the future is even worse!  An exercise in imagination, which can also be called desire, it changes even faster, yet still seems to be the same: Exactly as we would have it. </span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: lucida grande;">If we call present and material things real, then the past and future are made phantoms and mental illusions.  And Philosophy, which is both reason and belief, having only these phantoms as its possible objects, can be nothing but a gloss on the unreal.  Conversely, the world that we inhabit and experience can never be directly grasped by any systemic understanding.  Thoughts do not "exist" as real things do.  People think, to be sure, but thinking does not produce a thing.  For example, if I have a toy that, with appropriate prodding, can look like either an tow-truck or a humanoid robot, no matter how much I play with it, I will never have truly made anything.  I will have changed the appearance of a single object between some number of states, but those states are not objects in themselves; They do not exist separate from that real object they are predicated of, being only attributes of the object.  Likewise, a particular state of the mind does not constitute a separate thing, no matter how we call it "a thought."  But we can think of such things as separate, just as we can mentally separate the motion of a pendulum from the pendulum itself.  If we say that the present and actual things have a nature called "reality," then thoughts must have a nature differing from this.  What is this nature?</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: lucida grande;">The efficient causes of actual events are also sufficient; whatever exists in a given present results only from the state of the present just past, and causes nothing else but the state of the present to follow.  A given state can only have one cause and one effect.  But after one person perceives the event, if they report it to someone else, then its causes change radically.  Stories are formed in reaction to events or thoughts (which are themselves in reaction to events), and are are of differing nature from the actual.  The present exists as an actuality, but the past and future exist as stories, networks of unreal causes.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: lucida grande;">If a country falls to an invading army, it "means" nothing but that it happened, and happened simply, without grand and overarching purposes.  The conquering general might have plans and hopes for the territory he will gain, but this intent is not the cause of his victory.  For that, we must give credit to the circumstances of money and men and weather and luck that preceded his victorious moment.  And those circumstances can be traced to their equally meaningless efficient causes, and so on and so forth, event after event, present after present, as far back as reason investigates.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: lucida grande;">But if this were to happen in a story, the cause is in the intent of the author to communicate something in addition to the mere 'fact' of the event.  If the story is fictional, this intent might be, in the short term, to encourage engrossment in the excitement of violent uncertainty, and in the long term, to elicit sympathy in us for the conquered.  If the story is historical, the intent might be to explain how a certain era ended with the political and economic dominance of the conquering country, or the sweeping effects of some recent innovation in military technology, or simply to instill nationalist pride (or xenophobic fear) in the readership.  For these intents and any others, there is a meaning to the event, a purpose above any desire of the participants or requirement of the physical laws which might govern them.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: lucida grande;">This authorial intent does not (usually) arise from a dry, icy desire to manipulate the reader.  The meaning he wishes to communicate is often, especially in non-fictional works, what meaning the events truly have in his perceptions.  He does not merely believe there is a connection between the invasion and the dominance of the victor or the weapon, he </span><span style="font-family: lucida grande; text-decoration: underline;">sees</span><span style="font-family: lucida grande;"> it, as surely as he sees his hands before his face.  We are all both the readers and the authors of our past and future.  Our memories and desires are written, edited and rewritten by nothing but ourselves.  We force meaning upon the past and future, making stories from mere events, without even noticing ourselves doing it, so servile are our memories and desires.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: lucida grande;">This Philosophy is inseparable from our very sentience;  As long as we we are aware of both ourselves and other things, then we will try to see connections between the two.  And if this philosophy is, in some sense, what we speak of when we say "I," then it is our very selves that are lost in the face of ills.  It is our identity that is an illusion provided after the fact.  The soul is a story that a liar tells to himself, and philosophy can only exist by forcing itself not to know the truth of its non-existence.</span><br /><br />Some people might find this depressing.  Heck, some reports indicate that Rochefoucauld might have used his philosophy as an excuse for the most grating kind of self-important misanthropy.  I can understand why, but I don't agree.  For some reason, no misanthropy or nihilism, no matter their emo-tastic bleakness, can depress me.  I occasionally get antsy with self-loathing, sure, but thats an undramatic and familiar kind of depression.  The eventual annihilation I can expect from my life annoys me profoundly, but doesn't get me in the doldrums like believing that I haven't been the employee/child/friend my boss/parents/friends deserve.
