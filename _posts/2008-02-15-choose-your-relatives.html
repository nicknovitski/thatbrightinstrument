Found by the Sister while trying to find my blog (Why didn't she ask me?  It is a mystery!): <a href="http://www.genetics-gsa.org/pages/novitskiaward.shtml">The Genetic Society of America's Annual Novitski Prize</a>.<br /><blockquote>The Novitski Prize, named in honor of            Drosophila geneticist Edward Novitski            (1918-2006), is designed to recognize an            extraordinary level of creativity and            intellectual ingenuity in solving            significant problems in genetics            research. The award recognizes            scientific achievement that stands out            from the body of innovative work, that            is deeply impressive to creative masters            in the field, and that solves a            difficult problem that may have evaded            the genetics scientific community. It            recognizes the beautiful and            intellectually ingenious experimental            design and execution involved in            genetics scientific discovery.</blockquote>He published <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=author%3Ae-novitski&amp;btnG=Search">over a hundred papers</a> and <a href="http://books.google.com/books?lr=&amp;q=author%3A%22edward+novitski%22&amp;btnG=Search+Books">three books</a>.  The two more interesting ones are, at closest, to be found in the University of Maryland and the Library of Congress, but the famous one, The Genetics and Biology of Drosophila (fruit flies, to those not in the genetic know), is <a href="http://worldcat.org/wcpa/oclc/2397390">in the college library</a>.  Getting it now.<br /><blockquote>Genetics            researchers using Drosophila and other            model organisms have, over the years,            conceived of and executed experiments            that are monuments to an exceptional            caliber of intellectual creativity that            were impressive to colleagues at the            time, rewarding to the researchers            themselves through the joy of cracking a            difficult problem, and are still            impressive today. It is important to            recognize the level of beautiful,            intellectually ingenious, and creative            experimental design and experimental            execution. You know when you see it,            when a master in the field says            something like, “Wow, how did they ever            figure out how to do that; it’s            beautiful.” (For examples of this, see            Novitski 2005, pp. 132-137.)</blockquote>Well, I would certainly <span style="font-style: italic;">like</span> to see examples of this in "<a href="http://www.google.com/products?q=141347084X">Novitski 2005</a>."  It looks like an interesting work.<br /><br />There's a game I read (and will soon be playing) that seeks to model the fiction of Wuxia, Heroic/Mythic China.  As in so many Role-playing games, there are points which can be spent to increase the heroes skills and capabilities.  Semi-uniquely, they can also be spent to tie the hero to the world in some way, which is why they are called "Destiny."  One of the things that can be purchased is a strong descent, "by blood <span style="font-style: italic;">or martial tradition</span>," (emphasis mine) from some famous or infamous folk from history.<br /><br />It's likely I'm not related to this person.  "Novitski" means "new people" in Polish, and it was the name given to any families who migrated over the eastern border unable to speak enough Polish to communicate effectively what their real name was.  Descent by blood is impossible, but descent by martial tradition is a matter of character and choice, and I think I might want to choose it.<br /><br />They say you can't choose your relatives.  They're full of it.  If you don't like the people around you, nothing is keeping you there besides you.  Leave, whether in spirit or in the physical as well, and find someplace more to your liking, full of people you'd prefer to dimly reflect, or better, to brilliantly improve upon.<br /><br />"Descent" is a misnomer, an artifact of medieval thought, that what was separated from us by the past was as glorious as our present was drab, that things could only descend, degenerate, as time went on.<br /><br />From now on, only Ascend.<br /><br />-Nick
