Anyone who wants to ever read for free the absolutely best horror story I've ever clapped these old eyes onto should hurry, because <a href="http://www.johndiesattheend.com/1-1.html">John Dies at the End</a> will only be available for you to click through, page after awful (meaning great) page, chapter after existentially revolting (meaning incredible) chapter for one more week.<br /><br />I mean, sure, you could buy the book, the way I am going to, even though I have read the whole thing.&nbsp; But then you might not be able to sit in your darkened room, lit only by lines of laconic text, punctuated by pictures of completely innocent things that may make you want to scream until you vomit.<br /><br />I mean, the thing about scary books, as distinct from scary movies (and that pretty much covers the range of horrific mediums, besides hay rides and wax museums) is that they can't just jump out and booga-booga you, right?&nbsp; They have to make you believe that you yourself are in danger from the threats present or implied in the text.&nbsp; I've seen this done in two ways.<br /><ol><li>The danger is so thoroughly described, it's as if you're experiencing it.&nbsp; It's just like how sufficiently convincing images on the movie screen can frighten us even when we know they aren't tangible.&nbsp; We comprehend them on an instinctive enough level that we can have instinctive responses. <br /></li><li>The danger is convincingly framed as something that genuinely menaces we the readers, as something that might have already touched our lives, or might someday, or is RIGHT BEHIND US OH GOD<br /></li></ol><br />Almost every Lovecraft story involves some awful revelation, a brief peek at something odd that allows the narrator to really get it, to realize that there are intelligent non-human entities that live in the ocean, or that asiatics and negroes are due to inherit the earth, or something equally "scary" (PS: Lovecraft was racist to the point of caricature).&nbsp; And it's supposed to be "scary" to us, because it's being presented as an account delivered by the guy who saw it.&nbsp; "You don't realize this," he says, "because it's hidden from us.&nbsp; But by chance, I was able to see it.&nbsp; Now you and I both know.&nbsp; Oh dear.&nbsp; *takes more laudanum*"<br /><br />David, the pseudonymous narrator of John Dies at the End, does not take laudanum.&nbsp; David drinks beer.&nbsp; David's not confident enough in his command of english to make you live in his shoes.&nbsp; He just wants to tell you about this stuff that happened to him and his friend John in their home town of Undisclosed.&nbsp; <br /><br />Stephen King sets almost all of his stories in Maine, because Stephen King lives in Maine, and his eyesight is far too poor to glean useful information about any other state, even nearby ones.&nbsp; Maine is not frightening, except in as much as Stephen King lives there and is still allowed to drive, despite having killed any number of people.&nbsp; Undisclosed is frightening.&nbsp; Undisclosed is in the rust belt.&nbsp; Undisclosed teeters on the edge of the end of western civilization, as the dehumanized, poison-spewing pain train hurtles off it's screeching rails into a hole a mile wide, shaped like a smile, from which faint screaming can be heard.&nbsp; Undisclosed is very frightening.<br /><br />David has lived there all his life.&nbsp; David is not good at talking about his feelings, so you don't get a lot of ooh-ing and ah-ing at his intense existential anxiety.&nbsp; He usually talks around it, because he doesn't want to sound like a pansy.<br /><br />I like David, and I like John.&nbsp; You might also.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.johndiesattheend.com/1-1.html">Read it now</a>.<br /><br /><br />-Nick
