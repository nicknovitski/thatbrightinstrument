<p>From<a href="http://icv2.com/articles/home/10725.html">ICv2 News:</a></p><blockquote><p>Wizards of the Coast has unveiled ambitious plans to construct a "next generation" online home for hobby gamers--an initiative that will focus on building a gaming community (including tools for hobby retailers), providing editorial content that supports hobby gaming, and offering games of interest to that audience.</p></blockquote><p>Currently, <a href="http://gleemax.com/">Gleemax.com</a> does nothing but look bad in Firefox.  Someday, it will do a great deal.  Offer social blogging for both players and professionals.  Find stores, gamers and events in your area.  Sell games.  Let you review those games.  Dragon Magazine + Amazon.com + one of Livejournal, Myspace or Facebook = <a href="http://www.gleemax.com/">Gleemax</a>.  But which one of those social networking sites will it most resemble?  That is, what will the target demographic be, and therefore, what sort of culture and atmosphere may we expect from fellow users?  Frat-boy Halo players?  Gen Y Pokemon players?  All-ages Yahoo flash games players?<br /></p><blockquote><p>WotC feels that it has identified a psychographic profile of the hobby gamer that is different from videogame players, and <a href="http://www.gleemax.com/">Gleemax</a> is designed to appeal to that psychographic and recruit new members to the hobby gaming community which in the past was populated almost exclusively through core hobby stores. </p> </blockquote><p>They have probably spent more money on 'psychographic' studies than I will earn in three lifetimes, so I'm already listening.  In the <a href="http://www.icv2.com/articles/news/10687.html">linked interview</a>, "VP of Digital Games" Randy Buehler elaborates.</p><span class="text"><span class="text"><blockquote>I don't know what the word is to refer to online strategy gamers plus tabletop gamers.  I've been using "hobby gamers" to try and capture all that, but I'm not sure we have the right word that would cover the whole audience yet.</blockquote></span></span><p>So basically, people who play games, in the broadest sense.  Experience makes me lean towards thinking most computer-mediated games are a lot a cross between juggling and watching a movie.  Fun, but not having fun with other people.  I might be missing a point, and the terminology definitely needs to be hammered out, but my experience accords with their psycho-whoosit study.  Like in this part:<br /></p><blockquote><p>"Our read on the core hobby industry is that it's stable, but it's aging," WotC VP of Digital Games Randy Buehler told us.  "We're slowing down in terms of recruiting that next generation of hobby gamers.  Today's 15-year-olds have such a different experience than a 15-year-old did five years ago or 10 years ago, or when I was a 15-year-old.  So today's 15-year-old is online and doesn't necessarily have any reason to leave his computer because there's so much to do there."</p></blockquote><p>That's what I've seen too, except that in plenty of markets all the card games that aren't <span style="font-style: italic;">Magic</span> (i.e., <span style="font-style: italic;">Yugioh</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Pokemon</span> et al.) go like gangbusters.  Is it possible this report is centered on Wizards of the Coast/Hasbro products?</p><blockquote><p>We obviously spent a lot of time studying our player base, and it's not just the <i style="">Magic </i>player base.  <i style="">D&D </i>is a huge part of our business and we spent a lot of time studying trends and what we think is going on in the industry.  Our research, both our internal data and our market research shows us that we're not recruiting as many teenagers as we were five years ago.  I guess we're assuming that's true of the whole industry -- we make up enough of the industry that if it's true of us it might be true of everybody.</p></blockquote>Hehn.  Not really, of course.  In fact, the more one company dominates their sector, the less significant that company's data becomes for others in it.  Inasmuch as a small company would be surviving at all in such a condition, it would have to be offering something significantly different from the dominating company.  If I'm <a href="http://www.lumpley.com/dogs.html">Vincent Baker</a>, there's a limit to how much the demographics of <span style="font-style: italic;">Dungeons & Dragons</span> players affects my business.  If their sales drop by 30% and mine rise by 300%, the net effect would be thousands of people dropping out of the hobby altogether, but by now, we should have learned from the juggernaut rise of online "casual" gaming that games can be made to appeal to humans, not just gamers, and there's plenty of board and role-playing successes along those lines.<br /><p>Speaking of all this bizarre indie alterna-gaming, will we even be able to talk about it on this funky new site?  Survey says: Yes, and that's not all!<br /></p><blockquote><p>But <i style=""><a href="http://www.gleemax.com/">Gleemax</a> </i>won't be a "WotC Only" zone, as WotC's Randy Buehler told ICv2 <a href="http://www.gleemax.com/"><i style="">Gleemax</i></a> will be: "a home for gamers brought to you by Wizards of the Coast, but not controlled by Wizards of the Coast." WotC will let competitors set up in the social network space and will allow criticism of WotC and its products as well. To foster this independence WotC is setting up a <a href="http://www.gleemax.com/"><i style="">Gleemax.com</i></a> Advisory Board that will include "industry thought leaders" and WotC is holding an open casting call to fill three gamer spots on the board.</p></blockquote><p>So Wizards of the Coast is spending millions of dollars to get hundreds of thousands of people to know about YOUR game.  They're gathering an audience and creating a community, and as an aside, they're creating a new distribution channel as well.  Kudos to them for not being evil!  By keeping it open, they've managed to avoid a major chance to shoot themselves in the foot.  It's almost as if they are genuinely trying to foster a healthy and open community!</p><blockquote><p>I think the draw is the community. We think the first thing you want people to run into is other people. The games are secondary in our opinion. The right way to grow the hobby industry is to invest in hobby gamers; it's to invest in people and community. If those conversations are interesting and those friendships start to form, we all win in the long run. I really think the community content is the gateway.</p></blockquote><p>So there you have it.  The psychographics don't lie: The advantage of tabletop, the distinction of "hobby," it's all about playing with things we recognize as human, generating positive social feedback.  The internet may be, as I have known others to say, a steaming pile when it comes to forming calm, informed consensus, but it's not terrible for making friends, or promoting things, or selling things.  I hope that <a href="http://www.gleemax.com/">Gleemax</a> will be really cool, that it's the first social networking site I sign up for without immediately regretting (stupid Facebook!), and that I see all my game-friends there.<br /></p>
