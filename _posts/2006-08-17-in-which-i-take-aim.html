<a href="http://gamepolitics.livejournal.com/329723.html">From gamepolitics: An NRA-branded Shooter where you only shoot tin cans, watermelons, and thieving negroes. Wait, did you record that? Oh shit.</a><br /><br />Guns are devices designed for killing. Not for entertainment, nor for defense, but rather for murder. I don't see why we can't start a legistlative-outlining process with agreement on that common point, as their outlawing (or even regulation) doesn't necessarily follow. If we're talking about something valued only by criminals, cowards and folks who just get hard from killing helpless animals, I think those groups should recognize their common ground and form a single umbrella lobby addressing the issue, and leverage what numbers and money they have to...<br /><br />Oh, wait.  NRA.  Huh.<br /><br />Well, they're one step ahead of me again.  Now we just need to get them to sit down at the negotiating table!
