Last night, at the Compleat Strategist's weekly get together, I played a game of <a href="http://docs.google.com/View?id=dct676c8_142fk56pjc9">Happy Birthday, Robot</a>!<br /><br />I enjoyed it a great deal. &nbsp;Choosing and arranging words was fun, and that play produces a poetic artifact, a kind of picture-book libretto, pleased me immensely. &nbsp;I would absolutely play it again, and would especially love to try it for a longer series of sessions. &nbsp;I wonder if it would adapt to campaign play with a varying pool of players?<br /><br />Two of the players were young, and invested in making the story incoherently silly, or just maximizing their ability to negate whatever was being claimed by the storyteller. &nbsp;I joked at one point about only adding words like "not," "didn't," and "couldn't," but on the whole, it was surprisingly disruption-resistant. &nbsp;When you pull tangled threads in different directions, they mesh and knot to make something unexpected, but strong. &nbsp;Or some other metaphor.<br /><br />I see that the playtest draft has been altered to only let you roll three dice at one time. &nbsp;That's probably for the best. &nbsp;Some of our players were rolling 16 at a time, resulting in much longer sentences, resulting in coins getting flipped sooner than they would have, resulting in the game ending sooner than it would have.<br /><br />Here's the story we came up with:<br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;"><b><span style="color: red;">Happy Birthday, Robot!</span></b></span><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"><i>by Dee, Chris, George and Nick</i></span><br /><i><br /></i><br />Happy Birthday, Robot!<br /><br />Robot wakes up and checks his fluffy pink cellphone, but the battery is dead.<br /><br />Robot sighs and makes coffee, but the coffeepot is broken.<br /><br />The sun shines warmly on red Robot, and he feels at peace, but radioactive bunnies fall from the sky!<br /><br />Robot braces against their scolding words, but falls down hard.<br /><br />Rising to his feet, Robot laughs a cheerful laugh and shoots the bunnies down with his happiness-inducing laser-vision.<br /><br />Robot and bunnies start to break-dance maniacally, but the bunnies begin to bite him.<br /><br />The epic fight was soon over, and the voracious bunnies were exhausted for days.<br /><br />Robot looks upon his work and is glad, but still feels despair for the enslaved bunnies.<br /><br />Robot cries as he finds a single dead bunny nearby, so he brings it back to life, but Bun-Bun was changed!<br /><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;">[Ed: endgame triggered here.]</span><br /><br />Bun-Bun bit other bunnies, changing them into creatures that fed on brains.<br /><br />Satisfied, Robot went home. &nbsp;"I should charge my cellphone now."<br /><br />Robot received seven birthday messages; how auspicious!<br /><br />Meanwhile, the bunnies plotted Robot's massacre.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><b>THE END</b></div><br /><br />-Nick
