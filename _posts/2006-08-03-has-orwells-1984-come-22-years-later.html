<a href="http://rss.slashdot.org/%7Er/Slashdot/slashdot/%7E3/6761198/article.pl">From Slashdot: Has Orwell's '1984' Come 22 Years Later?</a><br /><blockquote>My video games spy on me, reporting the applications I run, the websites I visit, the accounts of the people I IM. My ISP is being strong-armed into a two-year archive of each action I take online under the guise of catching pedophiles, the companies I trust to free information are my enemies, the people looking out for me are being watched. As if that weren't enough, my own computer spies on me daily, my bank has been compromised, my phone is tapped--has been for years--and my phone company is A-OK with it.</blockquote>Didn't Philip K. Dick already settle this?  For that matter, didn't Aeon Flux?<br /><br />I have a hard time mustering distaste for the inevitable.  This kind of data has a value, and as the tools and techniques for getting it become cheaper, it will be more and more profitable, and therefore sought.  Now of course there's many sorts of abuses that we can and should curb, but as far as general transparency goes, I don't have anything to hide.  Amazon offers me suggestions for new books based on my previous purchases.  I'm not about to freak out the day a billboard addresses me by name and serial number.  Though I suppose my cynicism and apathy makes me a low-priority target.<br /><br />Is it strange to be able to get upset about, say, the FBI monitoring Martin Luther King Jr., but not at all about insurance companies having access to gene-histories?  I try to constantly test myself for unseen hypocracies.  Is this one that has slipped through?
