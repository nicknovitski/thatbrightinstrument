Developers and fans of analog games need to pay more attention to the digital kind.<br /><br />My main discussionary website has always been RPG.net.  Historically, there are a limited number of ways a computer-assisted game will come up as a subject of conversation in the <a href="http://forum.rpg.net/forumdisplay.php?f=3">Open forum</a>.<br /><ol><li>"I like playing this game!  I want to run a D20 campaign with special rules to emulate the important systemic and thematic points to recall the happy feelings I felt playing this game, which I liked!"<br /></li><li>"RPGs must adapt to a market changed by the overwhelming success of World of Warcraft.  If you can't appeal to kids more than flashing lights on a screen can, you're toast."</li><li>"Off-topic Post reported."<br /></li></ol>Thanks to Google Reader, I'm tracking about 180 different websites.  About equal numbers of them are devoted to physical gaming and virtual gaming.  I play plenty of video games, but not having gone to a technical school, physical gaming is closer to my heart and future earnings potential.  So why the even split?  Well, as communities, they're not so different as you might think.  Notably, there is a sense in certain quarters that a new kind of thinking is required to make the next kind of video-game, using techniques and approaches as-yet-unheard-of.   One of the approaches is even to be found in a nascent Indie movement.<br /><br />But the real story is in practical application.  I find that, despite their best efforts, the blogs of these video game designers have given me immense lateral insight into some of the questions I try to address in physical-game play and design.<br /><br />To back up my point, I will discuss a single post from a single video-game blog that made its way instantly into my starred items list.<br /><br />Tadgh of <a href="http://particleblog.blogspot.com/2006/07/stories-structure-abstraction-and.html">Particleblog</a> has decided that "interactive story" is a paradox.  The concept, he says, was based on the supposition that, since stories are structures (and epic stories are Campbellian Hero-quests), they can be produced and adjusted by a sufficiently complicated mechanic (running on a sufficiently complicated computer, of course). However, he asserts that though...<br /><blockquote>...all stories start with a rough framework in mind (such as Campbell), they then become more and more delicately structured on their own.<br /><br />For example, sub-plotting and character arcs are part of a story's structure. Symbolic development is part of a story's structure. Scene construction and pacing are part of a story's structure. The more carefully structured a story becomes, the more individuated from the basic framework it becomes. The more that happens, the more it departs from any sort of specific rules of story construction, and the more that that happens, the better the story becomes.<br /><br />All stories are indeed structures, but what the interactive storytelling community have failed to appreciate is that all the <span style="font-style: italic;">best</span> stories are <span style="font-style: italic;">brittle</span> structures.</blockquote>Well and good.  Of course, the networked array of neural-net processors we call the gaming group has several advantages here over the computers that Tadgh is imagining.  First, like TCP/IP, we are able to cope with lossy communications; Not everyone in the group is going to be fully dedicated to producing a story <span style="font-weight: bold;">all </span>the time, but those who are focused on that activity breeze past the mental presence or absence of other players.  I can have an intense experience alone in an rpg.  In fact, thanks to not realizing that other people might have different gaming priorities than me, I bet most of my intense roleplaying experiences have been lonely ones.<br /><br />Second, human computers are pretty goddamn powerful, and they are specialists in organizing patterns, and stories, I don't mind affirming, are patterns and patterns only.  The Things Which Have Happened are not a story, but what we create with them will be.<br /><br />Moving on, Tadgh blames the "the perpetuation of the idea that games and stories are converging" on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Rein-Hagen">Mark Rein*Hagen</a>!  White Wolf's rebranding called adventures "stories" and campaigns "chronicles" and GMs "storytellers,"  resulting in the following brain-damaged chain of reasoning:<br /><blockquote>* Movies and games must be coming closer together because games have storytelling in them, and therefore characters and arcs<br />* The story of Chess exists because games and stories are linked. Since Chess has no audience, the story of Chess must therefore be a story that the players are telling to themselves<br />* And since stories are structures it therefore follows that since Chess is also a structure, and since games and stories are connected, that some kind of interactive storytelling engine is possible.<br />* So I can play storytelling games without the need for a Storyteller</blockquote>It seems reasonable.  In fact, having read Polaris, it seems inevitable.  But, playing without a storyteller means, in this case, playing only and exactly according to the prewritten rules.  Every roleplaying game I've seen "without a GM" really just shares GMing duty, or more specifically, the right to Veto.  In order to enhance enjoyment, sometimes we don't play by the rules every single little time.  But Tadgh would say that in a normal and complete and good game, there are rules and rules alone.  Chess.  Football/Soccer.  You could get touchy-feely and let people do takebacks or not count clearly unintentional handballs, but inasmuch as you were doing that, you'd just be screwing around and not playing the game.<br /><br />Essentially, a GM is like a king, if sometimes a benevolent or effectively constrained one.  GMless games (Chess, Football) are more like the rule of law.<br /><br />Tadgh then (independantly?) discovers the impossible thing before breakfast.<br /><blockquote>And also missing out on one more thing. Rein*Hagen's games were never really "storytelling" games in the first place.  They are roleplaying games, just as D+D, Call of Cthulhu and Paranoia. Tabletop roleplaying games are not storytelling experiences, they are shared fantasies with a fluid and robust structure which share a fiction but not a story.</blockquote>He defines a game:<br /><blockquote>A game (of any stripe) is an abstract space with robust rules in which one or more participants is able to take any kind of action subject to the constraints of that space toward a pre-determined goal. </blockquote>Games are best when their rules are simplest, allowing for the maximum freedom within those rules (Chess, Football).  They sometimes produce emotional experiences, and sometimes don't.<br /><blockquote>In a tabletop roleplaying game, when the quest is on and the players are trying to figure out a way to storm the Castle Perilous, the rules may appear complicated, but the Games Master is on hand to short-cut all of the tedious bits, make arbitrary decisions that move the pace on a bit and otherwise get the game going where it needs to go. The Games Master acts as a counter-weight for elegance and robustness. Sometimes this provides moments of real drama. Sometimes it doesn't.<br /><br />And so too in videogames. Deathmatch games of Counterstrike are no different to games of football, quest games like God of War are no different either. You have the space, the challenge and the abstraction that makes it possible to play within well-understood boundaries. To call this 'story' is utterly ludicrous.</blockquote>My approach to enjoyment has been eviscerated!  What is left me?!<br /><br /><blockquote>What games have, on the other hand, is fictions.<br /><br />Fiction is a shorthand term that says "the imaginative character of the spaces in which games are played". All game spaces have character of some shape or description. Chess and football have a symbolic character, Tetris likewise. That is the sum total of their fictions.<br /><br />Many games have more complicated fictions than this. Vampire: The Masquerade's setting, the World of Darkness, is a very long and involved fiction. Final Fantasy VII's is likewise. Most games fall somewhere in the middle in terms of complexity. The best games are those that mirror fiction and gameplay together to create a robust, elegant game that the players can functionally play with relative ease and symbolically/imaginatively enjoy likewise. Football would not be football with the crowd chants, it would be anemic. Paranoia would not be Paranoia without the whole "Glory Glory the Computer" songs and Resident Evil would not be Resident Evil without the zombiefied villagers.<br /><br />The big difference between recognising the qualities of a fiction and misinterpreting it as am interactive story experience is in seeing that the system underpinning the fiction is robust (i.e. it's an abstract game) and therefore the best fictions are always the ones that are driven at the player's behest. Chess would simply be irritating if after every five moves a neutral judge read out lines of poetry, and many videogames are irritating because of their long ponderous cut-scenes that serve no purpose in advancing the gameplay or exploring the fiction. Great fiction always works at the behest of the player in a manner that furthers their exploration and advancement of their gameplay.</blockquote>And if that doesn't give you something to think about, I'll eat my hat.  And I don't have a hat.<br /><br />Several responses to this post were also star-worthy.  I especially liked the one at <a href="http://grandtextauto.gatech.edu/2006/07/24/sandcastle-construction/">Grand Text Auto</a> (Yeah, Georgia Tech!  Woo!) and <a href="http://kingludic.blogspot.com/2006/07/story-with-little-s.html">King Lud</a>.  Also in the same vein was the fantastic bit on Lost Garden about <a href="http://lostgarden.com/2006/07/ze-story-snobs.html">Ze Story Snobs</a>.  I was originally going to talk about that one, before I saw Tadgh's post.
