Today I complete my twenty-sixth year.<br /><br />My birthday has always fallen near the end of the school year, which is usually less-than optimal: People are distracted by a host of concerns, real or imagined.  Camps, trips, flights, drives, hikes, bikes, vacations and visitations.  Jobs, work, service, practice, classes and college.  Plus, of course, parties, parties, parties.<br /><br />But for me, this is the year that college ends.  Most of my classmates are planning to get further schooling, feeling (I can't imagine why) that they are not prepared for their career of choice.  But some face the real world for the first time.  They feel a more intense set of concerns now than perhaps they did in past years.  So it's more forgivable this year than ever before, and it's always been forgivable.<br /><br />Notable events of the past year:<br /><ul><li>Became a college senior.</li><li>Was in a college play.</li><li>Attended my sister's wedding.</li><li>Wrote software for the Jane Goodall Institute.<br /></li><li>Founded a school club.</li><li>Made friends, lost friends, avoided watching <span style="font-style: italic;">Friends</span>.</li><li>Stopped playing World of Warcraft, started playing World of Warcraft, applied for job working for people who make World of Warcraft.</li></ul>Planned events for the coming year:<br /><ul><li>Graduate from college.</li><li>Move to...somewhere.<br /></li><li>Provide for my own livelihood.</li><li>Practice writing, composition, and design, LAMP, a host of scripting and programming languages.<br /></li><li>Make a portfolio.</li><li>Proselytize gaming more.<br /></li></ul>It's a short list.  Minimizing expectations is a talisman against failure, but if you're reduced to making talismans, you're already afraid.  We shouldn't live in fear, shouldn't let it shape our decisions, should accept the charge of prideful gladly if it would give us the chance to briefly rise above the dirt from which we are composed...but our strength is sporadic.  Fear lives in us, at the base of the skull, the spine, the tender trembling joints of the fingers.  It spreads out from the infection points unnoticed until we suddenly notice our parts failing to respond, and fall to our knees, or else the fear leaps up in a cold wave to batter and drown that union of parts which we want to call "me."  However we beat back that salt tide, it retreats to lurk in those unassailable redoubts.  It can't be destroyed except by destroying them, which many people find the courage to do, but after which they had, as it were, nothing further to say on the matter.  "To not live in fear" is oxymoronic.  Non-vegetable life only lives because of its fear, its retrograde reaction to things which will negatively impact its survival.  Fear must remain, at least for those things which must be feared, and so other things are tainted by it and we feel fear for them as well.  Someday there may be made beings who don't fear anything except what they really should, but until then, I remain alarmed by the dark, bugs, and failure.<br /><br />Any yet, let it be said: Though when I graduated high school, fear drove me to not attend St. Johns, I came back, and I will leave on my own power.  Our strength is sporadic, but that cuts both ways.   Sometimes we are strong, and I ask no more than "sometimes" from life. <br /><br />-Nick
