Last November, there was a mild furor in Video-Gaming Politics over some me-too comments Roger Ebert made, to the effect that videogames were not and never would be art, amen.  It's pretty easy to dismiss that as ignorance, especially considering Ebert confessed in the same breath that he doesn't play any.  But he had his reasons.  To whit:<br /><blockquote>Video games by their nature require player choices, which is the opposite of the strategy of serious film and literature, which requires authorial control.    <br /><div class="indent1">I am prepared to believe that video games can be elegant, subtle, sophisticated, challenging and visually wonderful. But I believe the nature of the medium prevents it from moving beyond craftsmanship to the stature of art. To my knowledge, no one in or out of the field has ever been able to cite a game worthy of comparison with the great dramatists, poets, filmmakers, novelists and composers. That a game can aspire to artistic importance as a visual experience, I accept. But for most gamers, video games represent a loss of those precious hours we have available to make ourselves more cultured, civilized and empathetic. </div></blockquote><div class="indent1"></div><br />Okay, so that's still easy to dismiss.  I've experienced plenty of work by "the great dramatists,<br />poets, etc," and I know that plenty of it was just as commercialized, popular among the young and broadly reviled by proponents of the previous order when it was young and new, from Dickens to Tolstoy, from Plato to Dante.   I know further that this re-occurrent principle does not degrade their eternal value, but rather elevates any number of modern works, including certain games, to the same exalted status.  Further, considering the face-time, social contract and, more and more often, sophisticated thematic resonances of non-computer-mediated RPGs (which are what I hope to principally consider), the "cultured, civilized and empathetic" complaint falls flat.  People who don't have emotional reactions to playing <a href="http://www.septemberquestion.org/lumpley/">Dogs in the Vineyard</a> belong in the DSM-IV.<br /><br />But Ron Gilbert, <a href="http://grumpygamer.com/">super-happy-famous-succesful designer person</a>, immediately agreed with Ebert (that Art does require Authorial Control), then refocused the conversation on what he saw as the important point.  It was a move to would have done my <a href="http://www.stjohnscollege.edu/asp/main.aspx?page=1303">seminar</a> tutor's proud.<br /><blockquote>I think games both need <span style="font-weight: bold;">and have</span> Authorial Control.  There has to be someone at the helm who is giving us their vision for the experience.  Movies have a Director, Books have a Author, and Games have a Designer (titles in games in a complex issue I won't get into here). <br />I don't think Roger has thought about this.  He sees toys and doesn't see the person or people behind them and that is our fault (dear lord... when will we stop screwing up). <br />Take GTA:SA.  Who designed it?  I don't know.  I could probably look it up but I won't because I shouldn't have to.  During the debate about GTA, where was the designer?  Why was he or she not speaking out, letting us know why they did things the way they did, defending their art?  Did I miss it? </blockquote><blockquote>During the controversy surrounding <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0110632">Natural Born Killers</a>, Oliver Stone was very vocal about the film and his vision behind it. </blockquote><blockquote>This is why the games industry needs more visibility to the people behind the games.  It is this humanizing that will ultimately pull them into the realm of art.</blockquote><br />This humanizing visibility I call <i>Voice</i>.  The term refers both the vocalness Mr Gilbert calls for and to the distinctive stamp a Creator puts on a Work.  I see Spike Lee as the poster-boy of this theorized combination; I think he proves that both are two sides of the same coin of strongly presented Identity.  Now, it is possible to say that both of these factors are less strongly present in gaming products than in other media, but since RPGs haven't had to defend themselves from the Self-Appointed Arbiters of Culture for a decade or so, what really hit me, reading all this, was the latter factor.<br /><br />Open up the D&amp;D 3.5 player's handbook and try to tell me about Authorial Control, try to tell me something about the people responsible for its creation.<br /><br />Thanks to their convention and creative preference, we have expectations from a movie by M. Night Shyamalan, a book by William Gibson, a song by Thom Yorke, or a comic by Grant Morrison.  Creative works don't tell us everything about these people, but they do tell us how these people approach creative works, and in the case of gaming, when "experiencing" the work means taking your own approach, knowing what the voice of the author has to say is very important.  Probably inherently more important than in non-interactive art forms.<br /><br />Independent RPGs have had voice in spades.  Reading <a href="http://www.sorcerer-rpg.com/">Sorceror</a> is, for long passages, very similar to listening to Ron Edwards talk very honestly and clearly about how he thinks about gaming, and the same is (only slightly less) true for any number of other games.  Over the Edge is the earliest game I know of to have included essays on the subject right alongside the conventional material, and many of the indie writers admit to being directly or indirectly inspired by him.  Their work is personable and heartfelt, engaging for anyone who likes to feel respected as an intelligent co-creator.<br /><br />Of course, there is also an impulse to do the opposite.  Common wisdom says that adding Voice reduces professionalism.  Journalists at <a href="http://nytimes.com/">real newspapers</a> will tell you to save that kind of halfassery for a Column, or better yet, the Letters page, or better yet, your cute little blog back home.  They say that art loses its soul when it becomes rich, but I say that work becomes navel-gazing when it becomes soulful.  However important approach may be to rpgs, if you are writing a game and not a collection of critical essays on the state of the art, you need to recall the purpose of every word and page as the play you hope to help people create. Trust your educated and interested readers to be able to understand what they are supposed to do, if your rules and examples are clear enough.<br /><br />Edit: I just saw that Chad Underkoffler talked about this in <a href="http://chadu.livejournal.com/415255.html">his review of vs. Monsters</a>.<br /><br />I think this is a razor's edge that people don't always know that indie designers are treading.  Games aren't newspapers, but there still is an abyss yawning on the soulful side.  Fall in, and you end up with <a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/113758">Empire of Satanis</a> or the more self-congratulatory bits of <a href="http://www.fatalgames.com/">FATAL</a>.  A tightly-knit group bites its own tail and produces subsidiary production cycles from a central cyclonic forum spin, which gather some new ideas and new participants before feeding them back into the Conversation.<br /><br />But don't think I'm trying to warn anyone.  I think this inbreeding (note to self: find better word) is a very good thing.  In fact, it's the reason I assume the hobby won't die. As briefly noted in the previous post, on the internet, things tend to succeed in the long run based on the accessibility of the public face of its author.<br /><br />On Voice, in other words.  Personality without ego, confidence without arrogance, accessibility without pandering or demagoguery, content full of character and character entertaining enough to be content.  I know nothing about the men and women who make Dungeons and Dragons, but it takes very little to know a great deal about the developers of any creator-owned content, those whose voice is self-regulated and not other-restricted.  I think that's why the indie manifestos have weight for me: We've all seen the results before in the webcomic and not-web comic publishing industries.
