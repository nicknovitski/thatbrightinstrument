The first Friday of June is consecrated to the sacred memory of the deep-fried batter-torus. &nbsp;I was going to celebrate it by eating my first non-shitty doughnut in a great many months, but I couldn't find any nearby. &nbsp;I can't stand these inflated, slimy <i>things</i>&nbsp;that most vendors seem eager to pass of as a pleasant treat. &nbsp;A proper doughnut has a texture like a dry, crispy muffin, not a ropey fungal&nbsp;souffl√©. &nbsp;The Devil take the man who invented "glazing" as it is currently practiced! &nbsp;Also, what's with spelling it "donut?" &nbsp;Why not just call it "fryd bred" and have done? &nbsp;And don't even get me started on "Krispy Kreme."<br /><br />Honestly, I'm pleased with there being a holiday for the doughnut. &nbsp;Days of&nbsp;remembrance&nbsp;frequently annoy me for seeming to marginalize important things. &nbsp;Black History needs constant discovery and integration, not its own month. &nbsp;Labor should rule the world, not be given one day in September for drinking beer and being used for about when to wear white. &nbsp;And that's leaving aside the downright offensive instances like Columbus Day, or historically-skewed presentations of Thanksgiving and Christmas.<br /><br />The doughnut is a small joy, and having just one day a year to celebrate it seems proportional to its importance.<br /><br />-Nick
