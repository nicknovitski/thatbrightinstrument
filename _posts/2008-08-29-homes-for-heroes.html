<span style="font-style: italic;">City of Heroes</span> is a game I played once.  If you aren't familiar, it's World of Warcraft, but you're a superhero in (I swear) an alternate universe Rhode Island.  It was fun.<br /><br />It is, to put it mildly, well-supported.  Besides the usual problem fixes, the designers regularly release Issues: large packs of entirely new quests, events, and game concepts.  You'd log in and now your hero could have a cape, or wings, or a hideout.  Gadgets were introduced as a new kind of power-up item.  Entirely new sets of powers for your superheros to use were created.<br /><br />Today <a href="http://reader.google.com/">Reader</a> brought my attention to <a href="http://www.cityofheroes.com/game_update13.html">this post</a> on the game's upcoming 13th issue.<br /><br />Actually, I had heard about it before.  Specifically, I had heard that this patch will allow players to create missions, quests, for other players.  I think that's a feature that will go from "No game does it except for that one weird one" to "every game has that in some form unless they suck" in record time.<br /><br />But what I hadn't heard of was this secret identity stuff.  Good grief.  It is:<br /><br />1) An absolutely brilliant way for a game to support the the conventions of the genre.  "Now that I've fought crime, I've got to get back to the Local Newspaper offices before anyone notices I'm gone!"<br />2) Yet another feature that no one else thought of and will soon become standard.<br /><br />Long before "user-generated content" was a buzzword, it was a simple fact.  <span style="font-style: italic;">Ultima Online </span>had a persistent game world where the players could own land and build houses.  This didn't seem revolutionary at the time.  In fact, <span style="font-style: italic;">UO</span>'s property system <span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;"></span></span>was extremely limited compared to that of almost any text-based MUD you'd care to look at.  People who played these things expected to be able to have houses.  Otherwise, they'd be homeless!  How terrible!<br /><br />And yet nowadays, good 3-d art assets being so terribly time consuming to make, not many games let players own and customize property in-game.  All those gorgeously kitted-out warriors of the Alliance, veterans of every great conflict in Azeroth?  Homeless.  Destitute veterans wearing and carrying immense fortunes.<br /><br />I admit that this bothers me.  Armor and weapons and history make you a wandering ex-soldier.  Property, renown, <span style="font-style: italic;">effect on the game world</span>, these things make you powerful.  Or at least feel powerful in a virtual context.<br /><span style="font-style: italic;"><br />Final Fantasy 11</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Granado Espada</span> and, as I understand it, <span style="font-style: italic;">City of Heroes</span>, use a system where an instance is created that claims to be, respectively, your imaginary apartment, family mansion, and hideout.  But no one can encounter these places in the normal course of play: They're abstracted out.  No one can go there except you and people you invite, meaning no one can discover it, no one can encounter it, just as they encounter Horn Mountain or the Well of Souls or all the other locations of the shared fiction.  No one is talking about that cool place where you live.  But despite this fugue-state-esque privacy, there's nothing unique or special about your home: They all occupy the same basic imagined location in the game world, since the entrances to these spaces are the same for everyone.  Everyone's apartment is down that street.  Everyone's mansion is behind these gates.  (I don't know if the Hideouts in <span style="font-style: italic;">City of Heroes</span> are guilty of this too.)<br /><br />This change means that your hero doesn't have to disappear just because you stop playing.  You can know where he is.  He builds a connection to a place that anyone can see, where everyone walks past.  He binds himself to the fabric of the fiction.<br /><br />Super-cool.<br /><br />-Nick
